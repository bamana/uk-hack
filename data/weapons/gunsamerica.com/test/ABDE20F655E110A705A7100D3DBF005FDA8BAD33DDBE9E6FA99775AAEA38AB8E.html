Along these lines, I wrote an article awhile back, &#8220;<a
href="/blog/5-tips-winning-hearts-minds-anti-gunners/" target="_blank">5 Tips for Winning Hearts, Minds of Anti-Gunners</a>.&#8221; Check it out. If the person is close-minded and stubborn, the Piers Morgan type, I&#8217;ll simply call that individual an &#8220;ass clown&#8221; and then simply go on about my business because let&#8217;s face it, sometimes you can&#8217;t fix stupid.</p><p>On Wednesday I read one of the most ignorant, vitriolic and prejudicial attacks on gun owners I&#8217;ve ever read. Titled, &#8220;<a
onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/blog.sfgate.com/morford/2014/12/03/black-friday-gun-sales/');"  href="http://blog.sfgate.com/morford/2014/12/03/black-friday-gun-sales/" target="_blank">Scared white guys spur Black Friday gun sales to record high</a>,&#8221; it was published by the San Francisco-based newspaper SFGate and written by Mark Morford, an ass clown of the highest order.</p><p>I thought about ignoring the article because the author of it is, as mentioned, an ass clown, someone who is so myopic in their disdain for gun owners that their incapable of having a civil discussion on the topic, but then there&#8217;s a part in the article that I couldn&#8217;t get out of my head. It&#8217;s the part where Morford profiles the average gun owner and explains why gun sales on <a
href="/blog/gun-sales-black-friday-best-ever/" target="_blank">Black Friday were record-setting</a>.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what he has to say:</p><p><em>You’re a scared white person, almost certainly male. You do not live in a major city, or near a university or intellectual hub of any note, nor have you ever traveled very far from your home town, much less out of state or anywhere further than, say, Mexico. Once. And that was enough.</em></p><p><em>You do not read complicated books. You do not like new or weird things. You watch lots of TV, mostly Fox News, which rejoices in showing you endless images of angry foreigners and minorities in pain: tear gas explosions, fights in the streets, looting, this time involving sad, small-town black people in Ferguson, all of them protesting the acquittal of that murderous white cop&#8230;</em></p><p><em>And so you think, “Well, now I have two reasons to buy a new gun: scary black people protesting within 200 miles of my home, and a dangerously out-of-control police force who might someday storm my house and confiscate my illegal taxidermy collection.” Ah, the perfect collusion.</em></p><p><em>Wait, make that three reasons: Toss in a Black Friday mega-sale at the local Gun Barn (30% off the AR-15, AKA “America’s gun,” the same semi-automatic rifle used in lots of massacres, and that killed a couple kids in Oregon just last year) and it’s off to the exhausted feds with your application.</em></p><p>Apparently we&#8217;re all rubes who have a pathological fear of big government and black people. And that&#8217;s why we purchase firearms.</p><p>I figured the best way for us to respond to these allegations was to just disclose who we are and why we exercise our Second Amendment rights. Again, we&#8217;re not going to change Morford&#8217;s mind, but for others who have read his article and my be inclined to accept his stereotype, let&#8217;s tell him who we really are.</p><p>I&#8217;ll go first. I&#8217;m a white male. Age 32. Residence: Buffalo, New York. But I spent the last decade in Los Angeles, California. Specifically Burbank and Sherman Oaks. I received a BA in English Literature from Canisius College. I have been to Mexico. Once. Cancun.  In college. And I&#8217;d go back, but I&#8217;d have to bring my GF.</p><p>I&#8217;m currently reading &#8220;Sister Carrie&#8221; by Dreiser. Prior to that, I read the novella the &#8220;Death of Ivan Ilyich&#8221; by Tolstoy. Are these &#8220;complicated&#8221; books? I don&#8217;t know. But they&#8217;re well written. I like &#8220;new&#8221; things and experiences. Though, I&#8217;m not sure I like &#8220;weird&#8221; things, activities. It depends on how weird we&#8217;re talking. Like, I&#8217;m not into sniffing bicycle seats in a public park, that&#8217;s really weird, but I do like weird and irreverent humor, e.g. Wes Anderson films. I do watch Fox News, but I also watch CNN and MSNBC. Quite honestly though, I watch more ESPN then the three combined. I&#8217;m a big NFL fan. GO BILLS!</p><p>I don&#8217;t like looters, carjackers and thugs, be they white, black, brown, yellow, red, purple or any other color, race or ethnicity. I have no problem with peaceful demonstrations and protests. I&#8217;ll admit, the looting and rioting in Ferguson is distressing, but it&#8217;s certainly not the reason why I am going to buy a firearm this holiday season or why I own guns to begin with. I own guns because I like to shoot, I like to hunt, and I like to know that I have the ability to defend myself, my family and my property in the face of an imminent threat. It would seem to me that everyone would like to know how to defend themselves should perilous circumstances arise. It&#8217;s not about being overly fearful, but about being prepared for the unpredictability of life.  Shit happens.  And if/when it does, I don&#8217;t want to be standing around wishing I was equipped to deal with the situation.</p><p>In any event, do I sound paranoid? Under-educated? Scared?</p><p>If you&#8217;d like to, in the comment section, tell them who you are, why you own firearms, etc. so we can disabuse those who believe in Morford&#8217;s stereotype of gun owners.</p><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-45912"><p>BS in BioChemistry, with a 6 figure income.  IQ of 135+.  Born in the Caribbean (Dutch roots many generations ago), and became a naturalized US Citizen in the &#8217;80&#8217;s (via the legal path).  Moved to the US to escape a government that had leaned too far Socialist.  I find that many US Citizens don&#8217;t know the freedoms that they have, or are supposed to have, as written in the Constitution.  It is sad, really&#8230;. and leads to twits like Bloomberg et. al., who seek to usurp rights in the name of &#8220;safety&#8221; and larger government.  I like to shoot.  It helps clear the mind and focus on something other than the hustle and bustle of work, etc.  I have a CHL, and live in TX.  I have travelled in EU, Caribbean, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Qatar.  I carry because I am a practical person and you just never know&#8230;  I&#8217;m 50 and have never needed to use a firearm for self defense, and I have many friends of different races, religions, and political leanings (I am conservative).  I know many people with liberal political leanings that also own and carry firearms.  This is a government control issue, and radical left-wing zealots that believe in Statist and/or full-blown Socialist change for the US.  They need to be stopped.</p></div><div

/> When I was growing up you could order firearms through the mail, anyone remember the  Sears and Roebuck  Catalog.<br
/> I have hunted and fished  for food when the family needed it .<br
/> I always respect and enjoy firearms, and I belong to a lot  pro  gun organizations and attend pro gun rallies and anti gun rallies.<br
/> I have found that anti gun liberals have their minds made up and you cannot confuse them with Facts..<br
/> I watch all the  news stations on TV  including BBC , It helps me form an opinion but I weigh it against what I believe in .<br
/> Then I do my best to voice my opinion  to try and persuade to my way of thinking , and always listen to opposing views&#8230;<br
/> When someone asks me why I carry a firearm ,I always ask them why they carry a spare tire in the trunk of their car . When  say and they always do tell me ,they carry it just in case they need it , I  have them!  If they are open minded they finally understand !<br
/> We ( pro gunners ) have a bigger fight  then we know.. but we have to keep fighting ..<br
/> As I read the comments here ,they brought a tear to my eye , I am very proud of everyone here .<br
/> Maybe just maybe we will win! Thank you all !</p></div><div

I see a gun as a tool like a pair pliers.  Most tools today you need a certain tool for a certain job.  Like a gun for instance,  I use it mostly for targets now but at one time I put alots meat on the table for my family.  I really don&#8217;t want to shoot anybody but if push comes to shove I&#8217;ll protecet that which is mine every time and to my fullest ability.  Lets face the real thruth some bad people just need to be dead.  So if. You are a bad people stay away from me and mine.</p></div><div

I work in higher education as a program advisor and I have lived in Germany and other US states.  The women who are in my shooting chapter are well educated, mothers &amp; grandmothers from a variety of professional backgrounds.  We are only 1 out of over 200 chapters nationwide with a membership of over 4,000.  We are active in our communities as members of school boards, political representatives and charitable organizations.  I do not consider us to be the knuckle-dragging neanderthals that the author of that horrible article describes us to be.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48415"><p>I&#8217;m 75 yrs old &#8211; got my first gun when I was 6 and have had guns ever since. currently have a Sig 9mm. Springfield M1a, 2 other .308s and a couple of shotguns. Was on a competitive rifle team and am teaching my grandkids to use firearms. I live outside Phoenix AZ in the open desert where the most idiotic gun nuts come to play with their toys shooting indiscriminately and anything and everything killing hundred year old giant sahuaro cactus with rounds ricocheting in all directions. They use guns as toys, and they are NOT toys. Take you life in your hands to go out for a walk when these idiots are around. I happened to be riding my horse one day and came out around a hill to find 30 or 40 idiots shooting at targets in my direction &#8211; after screaming that I was in their line of fire a few quit shooting, but the majority kept firing.This was NOT an organized range, just some idiots with their new toys. Not to mention that this group and most others that come out to act out their weekend  stupidity leave mountains of trash wherever it is convenient to drop it. On of their favorites is to dump old appliances &amp; TV sets to use for target practice &#8212; and you wonder why sane people get upset with indiscriminate use and ownership of guns. So in addition to killing people, there are those of us who don&#8217;t care to live around gun nuts who take it as their inalienable right to spend their weekends shooting up my back yard. The worst of the barrage starts Saturday and keeps going until Sunday, so I get to listen to gunfire more or less non-stop.<br
/> In my opinion, if you really believe in the right to bear arms, then you must also admit to the responsibilities that goes along with the right. If you want the right then proper training is required ( not just a few hours of range training, but some serious training) and if you abuse the right by using a firearm irresponsibly, then you lose that right for  period of time or permanently depending on the offense, plus lose the firearm. I suggest you work to get legislation that supports responsible firearm training &amp; use as well as limiting indiscriminate use of firearms as toys. As it is now, I personally am against guns in the hands of the untrained &#8211; which is the majority of gun owners today.</p></div><div

I have 4 children one has a BS in childhood education, one is working on a MS in social work, one is just completing her PhD in social work and the other has technical degree. So we are fairly educated group. We have all traveled outside of the country. We have all traveled All 48 states some of us have traveled all 50 states. Guess what, we ALL own and shoot guns. Four of the  six have CC license.<br
/> We are a white family. Our greatest fear isn&#8217;t a black, brown or red man, it is a white male. By far, most of the crime in middle America is committed by whites. Just look in the papers in middle America. Yes black people get the most news print, but if you read the list of crimes committed, most are committed by whites.<br
/> In conclusion I would say that most of the anti gun lobby doesn&#8217;t have a real clue about the real world or what goes on in the real world.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-49762"><p>I&#8217;ve been shooting my whole life. I was on my high school rifle team and the Purdue ROTC rifle team in college. Then I served in the army and shot on the Army Gold National Match team&#8211;M14&#8217;s in those days. I own lots of guns, a few for protection.  But my real reason for owning guns is that I love to shoot.  Shooting is FUN! Take someone off the street who has never fired a gun, put them on a range with some fun targets and watch those smiles.  They&#8217;ll try to repress them, of course, but deep down they&#8217;re having fun. I don&#8217;t understand why the NRA and other pro-gun organizations don&#8217;t address  the issue of FUN which, after all, is why most people own guns&#8211;target shooting, plinking, hunting. When I&#8217;m asked to &#8220;give up my guns&#8221;, it&#8217;s like me asking a dedicated sports freak to no longer play football or basket ball. Yes, people do die from playing football, but no one seems to care.  Why? Because it&#8217;s all about fun. And that for me is what guns are all about.</p></div><div

I got my first rifle when I was all of six, I hunt and I like to fish, I am what you would call a trout bum, have flyrod will travel! I quit college going into my seconded year, when I determine that the instructors were nothing more than Communist, I when to flight school! Back then and even now you have to really study just to pass the written&#8217;s with a passing score, Some say I am a very bright guy who pretty much wasted his life could have done more with it than I did! I just chuckle and remember the time I flew some bug biologists around for the summer in Alaska in a Bell 206, they were not much for the out doors but I got all my flying done usually in a couple of hours most days and being next to one of the Greatest Sockeye Salmon Rivers, my Scot 9 foot 7 wt flyrod kept me not only in fish for my plate but world class sport that a lot of guys would spend 5 to 10 grand a week for and I gotten six weeks out of that deal, and then there was my last solo Alaska-Yukon Moose hunt, I learned my lesson on that one, that bull was my 17th and last one, I gotten to old to hunt those by myself, they are to big for me to handle alone now, and I don&#8217;t hunt with a buddy! As for books I read most of the classics and some more than once, I am trying to teach myself Russian so I can read War and Peace in that language, its driving me nuts but in a good way. Its something I don&#8217;t think I will fully accomplish in the time I have left, but it never was about the ending but the journey. So as I advance into curmudgeon status, I am still going to shoot my guns, and catch all the trout I can, I figure that I got maybe another 25 more years to go, so for that guy in SF, go sit on it as the Fonz would say!</p></div><div

I am amazed at the stereotypical crap people spew from the hole beneath their noses. I am a gun owner and proud of it. I live in Texas and have 31 years in the military.  Color, education,  nor stance makes a gun owner. I like guns and will always have one. I have a variety and like them all.   I own guns and even have a couple of bows because I like to shoot not because I&#8217;m afraid.  Not all minority gun owners are criminals or have criminal intentions. I have and still am faithfully serving my country and have the right to bear arms. I believe firmly in that fact and therefore will always be a gun owner.</p></div><div

Post graduate work -University of Georgia in industrial psychology- Served on National  and regional Boards of Directors for industry Trade groups including   serving as President  then Chairman of one of the most   influential trade groups  associated with agricultural industries. Served with trade groups meeting with government agencies and members of Congress with the purpose of rewriting the National Farm bill.  I Read at least one novel every two weeks on subjects as varied as history, religion, fiction and items related to my hobbies , and once a month, teach a men&#8217;s Bible Study class  and volunteer once a month to lead Bible study in a local retirement home. I own guns because they are an excellent investment, I appreciate the engineering and art involved in producing a fine fire arm, I enjoy target and skeet shooting, but most of all, I enjoy spending time in the field with my two sons, my daughter and my grand  daughters hunting deer and upland game. I have traveled outside the United States and visited every state in the Union except for four. Your profile is as far off base as one can be. Little advice to the yahoo that created the profile.

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-45933"><p>I have a BS from Univ. of Washington,  wife has BA in history and MA in education from Stanford; Son has PhD in Neurobiology from Harvard; middle daughter has PhD in medeivel  English liturature and is a tenure track professor at Villanova;  Youngest daughter is still in School and engaged to a senior software engineer at Google.  My Father and my four siblings are either PhD&#8217;s or married to one.  Family has traveled to Europe and Latin America repeatedly.  Subscribe to Science and Nature and I read most of each.  I grew up in a small farming city with two four year collages, both highly rated, and a community collage. In High School, in the 60&#8217;s, one would see lots of pickup trucks with rifles on a rack in the window, especially during during hunting season &#8211; even parked in the Student parking lot. I recall watching guys out in the student lot pulling rifles and shootguns out of their cars to compare and admire.  AND NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEIR FELLOW MAN.  It is the bigots who sterreotype us as this bigot does, that are afraid and therefore dangerous.  They don&#8217;t care for guns (for whatever reason) and, being bigots, they dont like people who are different from themselves. Apparently, they don&#8217;t mind taking away our gun rights because they think nobody needs guns.  Well, nobody needs a car that goes more than 55mph (remember when they took that  away to save oil, and now the world has a glut of it)  Nobody need to drink alcohol (taking that away made criminals rich and powerful, as has the war on drugs)  Nobody needs a softdrink larger than 16oz (How did that work out Mr. Bloomberg).  These people really do believe that the world would be a better place if everone thought like them and their friends.  That kind of thinking is what KKK did, and the NAZIs,  If one took this guys biggoted rant and changed a few words to make it aimed at some ethnic minority, it would sound like Hitler&#8217;s works.  And much of their social research is as flawed as Third Riech genetic &#8220;science&#8221; but anyone who critisizes their statistics must work for the Gun Manufactures.<br
/> I like guns because of the Mechanicalness of them (refering to Jay Leno&#8217;s explaination of why he collects motor vehicles); it&#8217;s a fastination with all the different ways people have found to solve the same problems.  I can identify with that because I too restore old British cars now that I&#8217;m retired.  And, like an automobile, a gun is a powerful machine that i can control.  (I think the appeal of horses is similar &#8211; and they too are beautiful)</p></div><div

I realized that this allows some nut to target her and am requesting that you either remove the words &#8220;at Villanova&#8221; or erase the entire comment.  Thank you,  John A. Hunter</p></div><div

Have been to more countries on this planet than that guy has problem any knowledge of in reality.   I am a rural person but I was also raised in a rural town.   Just because he likes looking at concrete and human waste vs trees, animals, fresh air and night skies is no reason to even mention that part..</p><p>Finally his words about &#8216;murderous white cop&#8217; are a telling thing about that author&#8230;   Obviously he is uneducated, cowardly, gay and what I would call one of the liberal SHEEPLE of our time&#8230;</p></div><div

A SF liberal man speaking about gun owners in this manner, reinforces the idea that a liberal SF gay is just a wimpy little idiot, that identifies gun owners in his stereotypical fashion. I knew many gay gun owners over the years. How does he feel about the butch lesbians that try harder then a man to be man-like?</p></div><div

Did a couple years at University, but was discouraged to find that most of the kids (and they were kids, whatever their age) were enjoying an extended adolescence on their parents&#8217; dime.  And the most politically active group were the Socialist Unity Party, which we later found out was directly funded by Comintern, the Soviet international branch.  I was usually smarter than most in class, but the studies seemed pointless, and mostly irrelevant to the disciplines involved. When offered a full time job, I took it, and worked happily for 20 years for various branches of our welfare department.  I could sleep easy each night knowing I was helping people get more out of their lives.  Helping them think, where possible.</p><p>My Dad taught me to fire a BSA .22 at about age 8, my cousin took me rabbit hunting with a double barrel at thirteen.  Recoil, never noticed it!  In later life I got into shooting sports, and especially enjoyed the conversation with the shooting veterans.  All were men and women holding potentially lethal weaponry, yet somehow each one resisted whatever urge liberals must feel we all have, to burst into a murderous shooting spree.   A sense of fun was combined with innate responsibility and self worth that being armed provides.</p><p>I live in New Zealand, where self defense with weapons is disallowed, and any move towards this brings about the cancellation of one&#8217;s firearms license.  Somehow I can live with that.  I am still fascinated by the skill and expertise of weapon designers and makers.</p></div><div

I own guns because I like to shoot and I refuse to be a victim. This means that I will rest easier knowing that I have prepared to be ready to defend my family from any threat. I enjoy traveling whenever I can and I like to think I have an open mind and will give most people the benefit of the doubt to a certain point. It is impossible to stereotype gun owners since we are all different. We come from different ethnic, social, and cultural backgrounds and it is unfair to say that we are all &#8220;white, uneducated, and scared&#8221;. Spend five minutes talking to a responsible gun owner and this will be made clear. To me, gun ownership is all about personal responsibility for mine and my family&#8217;s safety.</p></div><div

/> And all kind of fruit, from grapes to melons are real fun to shoot. (sniping citrus or melons @ 3-5 hundred yards, priceless)<br
/> Cheap &amp; fun steam can be had by shooting .22 or Russian Surplus into the bottom of a carbonated bottled drink laid on it&#8217;s side.<br
/> Shooting into the little round bottom using the volume in length<br
/> Watch the glass, but it&#8217;s like fireworks on a sunny day.<br
/> Enjoy!</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-45951"><p>I am a 53 year old black woman from Florida.  I have a bachelors in Computer Science and an MBA. I have raised three children and am self employed. My main reason for owning guns is I enjoy shooting and competitions as a hobby. I also enjoy archery. Now of course as I get older and see what&#8217;s going on, I see an additional benefit in that I am prepared to protect my family from anyone that thinks they can harm us. Owning a gun is not an indication of ignorance, but assuming such is definitely a sign of ignorance. But just like everything, there will always be fools that own guns and fools that don&#8217;t. What is truly scary to me is that an educated journalist could write such an uneducated article.</p></div><div

Most firearms enthusiasts I know are well educated and most have worked in industry or aerospace capacities. I have a B.S. and M.S. in biology,biochemistry and Doctoral work in virology. I have worked as a college professor teaching premed, worked in chemical and environmental industries as a high level manager, in the semiconductor industry and was R&amp;D Director for LaRoche Catalysts. I don&#8217;t feel uneducated, nor do I feel paranoid about my safety. I enjoy firearms for their intrinsic manufactured quality  and engineering design and because of an abiding interest in history, in which firearms play a major role. I believe owning a firearm for protection is much like owning a fire extinguisher &#8230;.if I need it, I want it to be handy. I will never understand why gun haters fear a simple wood, steel or plastic tool in the hands of a qualified, responsible citizen who will likely only use it for recreation or to save a friend or loved one&#8217;s life&#8230;perhaps even a liberal hoplophobe!</p></div><div

IQ of 160 with several certificates of education as well as an associates in applied science (computer technology) Born and raised in PA and purchase my first gun at 12 so I could hunt. (Mossburg  .410 bolt action shotgun) which I still own! Served in the U.S.A.F, have worked for several security services including Pinkerton and have driven tractor trailer for well over one million miles, raised 5 children, two of which are medically retired from the Army because of injuries sustained in Iraq and South Korea. I am very happily married, own a home, a jeep, a pick up truck, 2 dogs, 4 cats and live in a small city. The area I live in has a very low crime rate when it comes to burglary and more serious felony activities.(I would bet on a 70-80% gun ownership area) I carry a Ruger P-94 in 40 caliber on a daily basis and a Ruger GP-100 six inch stainless steel .357 revolver in a shoulder holster on occasion, a Beretta bobcat in .22 long rifle as a pocket pistol, and have even been known to carry my 1863 Army reproduction .44 caliber cap and ball pistol.<br
/> Since moving to this town almost 19 years ago, I have only heard of a handful of hold-ups or firearms being used in crimes other than domestic happenings. So, as you can see by the demographics, I don&#8217;t carry because of a perceived threat, I carry because there is NEVER a day that goes by that something COULD happen. I want to be prepared to protect my family, friends, and neighbors should something happen to threaten their lives or well being. I pray each day that this never happens but if it does, I hope I am in the right place, at the right time, to protect them or even myself. I do not belong to the N.R.A but that is a financial issue and not because I don&#8217;t support them. I do belong to the U.S.C.C.A as the insurance they offer is fantastic.<br
/> The person who wrote that article is obviously  a very racial person and also must be better educated than the Court that found the officer clear of charges as he very rudely commented on his guilt.<br
/> It would not surprise me to find out that the author ones several of his own firearms but is probably active in either sport shooting or target shooting but has chose to stand on the side of the line that has the biggest paycheck!<br
/> Thank you and God bless all past, present, and future soldiers of the United States of America!</p></div><div

I own a couple of CZ 9mm pistols, a Mossberg Tactical 12ga., a 1911 22 cal for plinking around and a Kel-tec PMR 30. Most likely I will purchase an AR-15 shortly but you won&#8217;t find me toting it to public places to do others harm. I like the notion of being able to defend myself or someone I love; after all I am in the business of helping others. After reading the NRA page on FB I decided it was not for me and I don&#8217;t watch Fox news or listen to Rush Limbaugh. Hope that does not offend anyone.</p></div><div

Police Officer for 21 years, (worked agencies ranging from Corrections, State Police, Airport Police, small town Police to major metropolitan Police), until I found out the hard way that I&#8217;m a Diabetic, now medically retired/disabled.  Have lived/worked in large metropolitan cities from one coast to the other, (having visited 23 states including Hawaii and the territory of Guam).  Started shooting with my father when I was 6 years old, went through the National Guard Armory gun safety course, started hunting at 8, (have loved guns ever since).  I no longer hunt anymore, saw enough slaughter of what criminals do to their victims and car accidents, to where I didn&#8217;t have the desire.  Lessons learned from being a cop for as long as I was, we couldn&#8217;t be everywhere at once and citizens should be prepared to defend themselves if possible, (which is why I still carry), until the Police arrive.  I now reside in the country on a small acreage, away from the hustle and bustle of the city as I enjoy the peace and quiet now, (in a state that allows citizens to carry concealed without a permit).  I&#8217;m an avid motorcyclist, gun collector, (including two class III&#8217;s), target shooter, self taught computer geek  as well as a host of other activities/hobbies as mobility allows.  I read everything from sci-fi to old westerns and study history as well as enjoy watching movies, (mainly action adventure, sci-fi, westerns as well as documentaries).  I have two grown children and 5 grand children.  I consider myself to be a &#8220;red blooded American&#8221; and believe in the Constitution and Bill of Rights and still willing to defend them if needed, by whatever means necessary.  As for the ass clown from San Fran&#8230;&#8230;.talk about narrow minded and uninformed, (WOW).  If anyone needs to take a good look around them, it&#8217;s him.  Take off the blinders, get out of your parents basement and see what the real world looks like, (especially who gun owners really are).  You will find we come from all walks of life and are as diversified as any group of people can be.  Gun owners remind me of motorcyclists, meaning they are some of the most friendly people you will ever find.  Sure there&#8217;s a few bad apples in the bunch, but that&#8217;s the same in any walk of life, (including cops, politicians, judges and anyone else you can name) &#8230;.but it doesn&#8217;t mean the rest of them are like those few, (although I think politicians may be an exception). <img

Suffice it to say that, after reading garbage &#8220;journalism&#8221; like that, it is clear that this person is one of those fools who feel that the degree is the education, instead of realizing it is the foundation upon which a person can build on to become a truly educated and wise person.</p><p>I find it oddly ironic and just another glaring display of his ignorance that most mass shootings take place in exactly the places he says the unwashed and ignorant gun nuts are not from! And they have all been perpetrated by people who are the exact opposite of his version of the reality of gun owners! The fact remains that all mass shooters have been from his world, not ours!</p></div><div

Worked for 12 years at the University of Oregon. I&#8217;ve been shooting since I was old enough to hold up a 22., to shoot at rabbits, snakes and such out in the desert. I now carry a .38 revolver most days, in my purse or in my pocket. That&#8217;s the thing the city folks don&#8217;t get. The use of a firearm isn&#8217;t just to shoot at people. I live outside of town and dogs often roam the area, some of them not overly friendly. And then there are snakes. I&#8217;d shoot at a human if I had to, but it would be based on his behavior not his color. I&#8217;m really tired of people who have very little brain themselves telling me what they think is going on in my head. The fact that they ASSUME I&#8217;m racist, because I&#8217;m white and own a gun, tells me they are the materials racists and radicals are made of, and pretty worthless overall.</p></div><div

He is a white gay male who actively participates in the gay movement in the San Francisco area.  He believes that most of the ills of the USA originated from George Bush, Sr and Jr.   He believes that guns (not people) in the USA are the reason for violent crimes in the USA and if you eliminate guns you eliminate crime.  He will tell you that police will protect him if he needs help but is first to attack the police when they defend themselves, especially if a minority (racial or sexual) is involved.  This type of person is directly responsible for gun control,  higher unemployment,  broken families, immigration problems, disasterous Obamacare and a total worldwide disconnect with the International community.  He is educated by people with his same preferences and ideas, and therefore understands very little beyond his own sphere of living.   In short he is YES, A MAJOR AZZCLOWN.  Sadly to say, nearly every newspaper and TV station in the country is run by people just like this azzclown.</p></div><div

If law abiding citizens who choose to exercise their right to own, carry and enjoy guns do not speak out firmly and constantly we will someday find ourselves without that right. Individuals like Mr. Morford who are vocal and sensational get attention. There is no question that the product he is selling is hatred and ignorance. However in today&#8217;s society hatred and ignorance sell very, very well and there is a long line of politically correct, ill informed consumers who are lined up to buy it. I am a 53 year old white male and I carry everyday. My wife chooses to exercise the same right. If a criminal decided that she was going to be his next mugging &amp; rape victim it would be the last decision he would ever be burdened with making. We are well traveled and culturally diverse with interests ranging from art to SCUBA diving. My wife is the formally educated person in our household. She is college educated and fluent in two languages. I had a choice between college or hard work as my learning vehicle. I chose the latter. I have never looked back or regretted the choice. Our base of close friends includes more minority ethnicities than it does whites. We are very successful business owners who share our hard earned wealth among our well paid, long term employees. We have achieved goals and attained success because we are open minded. We are independent thinkers who choose to not follow blindly along with opinions and talking points that others use as a crutch. We choose not to tell others what to do or how to live. People have choices. Some make good choices and some make poor choices. Our personal choice to own and carry weapons is not based in fear of the criminal or fear of the authorities. It is based in caution and logic. There are more criminals than there are cops. The odds are in the criminals favor. We simply choose to swing those odds more towards our side. It is our sincere hope that we never have to draw a weapon in self defense. However, faced with the choice we will defend ourselves. Mr. Morford if it is your life or your families life that is in danger we would step to your aid and defense as well. My guess is in that situation you would be more than happy to see two people on your side that chose to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.</p></div><div

I have two masters degrees and have lived in Europe and traveled extensively including several third world and Communists countries.  I live in a rural area after leaving the state of California because of their tax structure and lack of leadership on the political front.   I read many genres and just finished &#8220;Unbroken&#8221;, and now starting  &#8220;Our Documents&#8221;, covering the 100 most important documents in the National Archives.<br
/> I believe many of the problems facing our country stems from a lack of respect for  authority and not complying with the direction of the police.  Many  situations could  be avoided if people would comply with the law and law officers.  I also understand there are good and bad law enforcement officers as there are good and bad citizens.  Finaly, I also understand laws are for the protection of the people, however we do not have the right to pick and choose which laws we will obey.  Hold people accountable for all their actions and make the facts known about each case.</p></div><div

I&#8217;ve had to use a gun twice in my life, 1) to stop a would be robbery (he tried to strong arm rob me) and when he saw my .45 1911 he turned and ran.  No shots were fired.  2) to stop and then capture a knife wielding rapist who is now serving a life sentence in prison.  I&#8217;ve earned a BA degree in political science, history and business from a major state university, and have worked and earned everything I&#8217;ve ever had in life.  While I do not think there is any perfect scenario in politics, I do believe that this nation (USA) was founded on strict principles of freedom and individual rights (as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others).  We have a constitution and as Americans should honor and obey it.  Sad to say that this country has to many millions of uneducated and unknowing people who have elected people who want to destroy the freedom and prosperity this country has to offer and turn it into a dictatorial socialist nanny state in the same fashion of Venezuela, Cuba and the former USSR.  People like Morford are the tools of this socialism and thus must be disregarded and hopefully fired and replaced.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46095"><p>I&#8217;m a 48 y.o. white male. As the screen name directs I have a professional doctorate (for those uneducated liberals that means I am your means for health care when you get shot because you didn&#8217;t have a weapon to defend yourself) and a BS in Biomedical Science. I lived for 2 years in West Germany prior to the Fall of the Wall. I speak German fluently, and have read everything from Goethe&#8217;s Faustus to Harry Potter. I have lived from Oregon to Montana and visited much of the United States.  For the sake of the internet I own no weapons of any kind except kitchen utinsels, hammers, axes and a chainsaw or two.  However, I shoot A LOT.  I do this because I am scared.  I am also intelligent enough to know when I am scared and what to be scared of.  I am educated and wise enough in history and human anthropology and social behavior to understand when a person should feel fear as a warning sign of danger.  I am educated enough in statistical analysis and research to know and evaluate the probabilities of my chances of survival in various scenarios. I am also educated enough to know that I am more likely to be in a shooting incident or an incident involving a weapon used in defense than I am to be involved in a home fire requiring an extinguisher.  I own an extinguisher and am not afraid to admit that I do.  I have never used it except for a few times to actually (yes you should) practice with it. I have, however, &#8220;brandished a firearm&#8221; twice in my life once to save myself from a beating or death on a roadway by a thug who blocked the road forcing me to stop, and once to save a black female from rape by gang-members in Oregon while my wife covered me from a balcony with another firearm.  Both times I was very afraid, but also glad to have happened to have in my posession, at the time, a means to defend myself and others. Yes, I am a fearful white male.  But I am not uneducated, racist, or stupid, but I will probably see a lot of people in my clinic today who are!</p></div><div

Spent 10 years studying and/or working 16 hours per day to complete my education, traveled throughout the US, been to Asia, Europe, Mexico, Canada, with over two years abroad. I now read 3 books a week, mostly fiction but some bio&#8217;s for recreation only. I have a wife and 4 children who are all college graduates and  independent thinkers including  two sons who are both gun owners, even the one in California! Unknown IQ but 140 military GCT and 1400 GRE.  Own a number of rifles and pistols and enjoy shooting at the range. I try not to have any racist thoughts although I do object to loud mouth know-it-alls, no matter what race or color. Not afraid but think that there will be more stress in the US due to the Religious Fundamentalists and their take no prisoners approach to others.  Believe that the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s generation of college liberals have infested our Universities, caused more damage than any redneck organization, and need to be replaced with more balanced scholars. The 2nd Amendment is not the reason for the mass shootings but makes a good target for those seeking to gain media attention and funding from the likes of Bloomberg, et al.  I discount anything that comes out of the Bay area due to its mostly anti-American slant and its proclivity to lecture rather than do useful actions.  I am not a member of any political party and believe that with our currrent government, the less done, the better particularly by Congress.</p></div><div

I do sleep with three hand guns beside my bed  and a night light. In the late Sixty&#8217;s my school system was more interested in getting 18 year olds into the Army than into collage. My children were encouraged to further their educations, one with with a law degree and another her English PhD.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46129"><p>I own a lot of guns of various types, mainly because I own a Pawn Shop thou not a big one like on TV.  I have a 2 year associates degree and served 5 years in the Army, four of those years as an officer after graduating Officer Candidate School at FT. Benning Ga. Then 3 years in the National Guard. I was a law enforcement officer for 19 years. Left because the criminals were leaving the courthouse faster than I could after cases. Never fired my weapon at a single person during that time.  I have traveled to many countries both as a military dependent and as a soldier. Wounded twice in Vietnam so I know what death is about.  I read all kinds of novels, war stories (War and Peace), science fiction and biography&#8217;s because I love history.  I own personally about 12 various guns, from antique black powder to modern state of the art semi autos. I have traveled the country as a trucker and been in every big city. Saw none I would want to live in because of the filth, traffic, people and crime.  Went to Mexico twice, both times just across the border to say I had been. Both times did not stay long because everybody I saw, including women, were carrying guns or big knives.  My state allows open carry and because I own a pawn shop I do carry.  In my job I meet all kinds of people of every type and color. I dislike nobody unless they want to curse at me or my wife.  She is more likely to shoot them than I am. Not very tall, 5&#8217;6&#8243; so I rely on my training and wit to defuse most problems.  If you don&#8217;t like guns, don&#8217;t buy one but do not stop me and others from what we like to do. I don&#8217;t try to stop you from doing what you like to do.</p></div><div

Learned to target shoot as a member of my school&#8217;s rifle team, co-captain in my senior year.  Shot only air guns for many years after that, but came back to firearms a few years ago.  Concealed carry license holder who has yet to carry, but I may start soon, I just want to be fully comfortable with my decision to do so.<br
/> I read so much as a lawyer I tend to limit myself to magazines the last few years, but did read books on Nero, Custer&#8217;s Last Stand and the history of the AK 47 in the last couple of years.  My news info comes from NBC (TV and website), some newspaper reading, and The Economist, and occasionally other sources.<br
/> Yep, another uneducated cracker who cannot get his hands on enough guns.<br
/> My son is a college junior.  He has a friend from mainland China.  We took the young man to the gun range with us, where he fired only .22 lr = S+W 617 revolver; Sig 1911 in .22; and my son&#8217;s CZ552 (a wonderful rifle, beautiful stock and far more accurate than either of us!)<br
/> The young man seemed to genuinely enjoy the experience.  He asked me later that day if I believed in the 2d amendment. I simply said yes, and that it was critically important to our freedoms as Americans.  I did not discuss my recollections of the Tianamen Square protests and how they ended, although I felt that would have been a good example of why the people should be free to own firearms to shield against a tyrannical government.  He is a bright young man and I thought he should draw his own conclusions after a day with his friend and his friend&#8217;s Dad at the range.</p></div><div

Lived in Pennsylvania 1 year after discharge from Air Force. Native Texan and got back to Texas as quick as I could. Love to hunt for the food I eat. Use crossbow, rifle, pistol and shotgun.  Read an average of 2 books a month. Would love to read more but am too busy making a living. Proud to be an NRA Benefactor. I believe we are truly blessed to have the second amendment &#8211; first time in human history where the common man can freely possess equal force to use against evil, be it natural, criminal or government. To me, anyone who is too lazy to study human history and natural order carries no voice to argue against the merits of self preservation. As precious as it is, our first amendment has allowed deluded folks to spout untruths that can unfortunately negatively influence unthinking masses. It always boils down to 1 question. Why would any intelligent human freely surrender any tool that gives he or she the means of self preservation? Especially when human history shows us that we need all the tools we can get.</p></div><div

Apparently, you have not been educated in American history nor have you read or understood the  U.S. Constitution.  It guarantees citizens certain rights such as free speech, the right to keep and bear arms, and so on.  If you are a law-abiding citizen, no one can takes these rights away from you.  Here is some short advice:  If you do not like these rights and freedoms, go online today, buy an airline ticket and fly to Europe and stay there.  You will fit right in.  Otherwise, keep your smug, self-righteous, uneducated opinions to yourself and read Brave New World again.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46173"><p>3 degrees, traveled extensively.  Female white.  I got my first gun when I was 34.  My husband was going on a 6 week trip and there was a serial rapist in the neighborhood.  I have had gun(s) since then.  Once I got into hunting, I couldn&#8217;t get the local gun store to get around to cutting down the stock on a semi-auto shotgun.  I finally figured that I was as smart as those yahoos and would do it myself.  That&#8217;s how I got into gunsmithing and becoming a FFL.  Now a female friend and I are both NRA-certified pistol, Personal Protection Inside The Home, and Chief Range Safety Officer trainers.  We have started a Womens&#8217; Instructional group.  We are also going to be offering Concealed Carry courses very soon.  I am now 67 so the fundamental &#8220;need&#8221; for self defense has morphed into a love of shooting and hunting and sharing it with others.</p></div><div

I&#8217;m a veteran and current firefighter and as such I see the slimy side of life fairly frequently.  We were both brought up with guns and are safe and familiar with a large selection.  We shoot as often as weather and scheduling permits.   We both are pro-active about firearms&#8230;we try to educate the largely liberal segment of America that can&#8217;t tell you the difference between a clip and a magazine or an AR platform and an assault rifle.  While I&#8217;ve found a few that will talk intelligently I find that most anti-gunners simply lump us all into the category of &#8220;gun-owners&#8221; therefore &#8220;thugs&#8221;.</p></div><div

Mr. Blannelberry, I would relish an interview by you in my beautiful home, in the much maligned state of Colorado according to shallow dialog from upper east coast bureaucrats (I will leave the wonderful names out). I was raised in gun responsible home and everyone in my immediate family owns a gun. I am a member of a local range and they know me well. Most of the anti-gun establishment fail completely to realize the fact that a gun, knife, bow &amp; arrow, cannon, or any other weapon has never killed anyone and have yet to see a properly handled weapon harm anyone. Now, attach a harm intending human to it and therein lies the issue. Education is the key in a majority of issues as well as training. As far as Mark Morford the splendid journalist, it is the likes of him that we also serve our country – freedom of speech!!! Hail to the Mark Moron’s – oops – Morford’s of the shallow hoplophobe world!!!<br
/> Mr. Blannelberry, I thank you for all your efforts and carry on!!!<br
/> In closing: From My Cold Dead Hands…</p></div><div

Married w/ 2 kids.  Been to Honduras, Peru, &amp; Kenya.  what the original authoer fails to understand is that the 2nd Amendment has nothing to do with hunting or sporting purposes.  it&#8217;s about being able to resist a tyrannical government that is over-stepping it&#8217;s constitutional bounds.  At this point in my life, most of the firearms I have are of a practical nature.  a shotgun, a few hunting rifles, some 22&#8217;s for what once was cheap training, various pistols for carry &amp; home defense, &amp; an AK, just &#8217;cause.  I&#8217;m not scared, &amp; it&#8217;s not because I have lots of guns.  I have faith in an all-powerful, all-knowing, good God.  Wait, I guess that throws me back into the white un-educated demographic.  I have a very black kenyan brother-in-law (my sister&#8217;s husband) whom I love dearly who is Somali by heritage.  Yep, I&#8217;ve got a black pirate for an in-law.  Finally, exactly how many people (not war-zone related) have been killed by the AR style rifle?  It&#8217;s WAY less than those killed with a bolt action .22.  ave a nice day, but please refrain from calling me an ignorant, paranoid, racist cracker.</p></div><div

Left leaning, liberal hippie-type, with a strong affinity towards Christian Communism and Thomas Paine-style Socialism. I have some college and plan to return someday.  I bought my first shotgun this year and am very glad to join the ranks of gun owner for one of the reasons mentioned by Mr. Blannelberry: PREPAREDNESS.  I don&#8217;t want to be the only hippie on the block who failed to protect his family from the inevitable &#8220;come-what-may.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll ever have to use it, but I consider myself smart enough to not (pardon the pun) &#8220;shoot myself in the foot&#8221; by being ill-prepared, when and if it should become necessary to have a gun. So I agree, the stereotypes are wrong. Also on the subject of stereotypes, most thugs I know of wear suits, buy politicians, and steal pensions. Just sayin&#8217;  😉</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46203"><p>I&#8217;m a 61-1/2 yr. old man who obtained my first firearm at the age of 11 years of age, by mowing my Great Uncle&#8217;s acre, all summer, (with a gasoline push mower) while he was out of town. He surprised me with a used, single shot, bolt action, .22 cal. rifle as payment for something that I believed I was doing out of the goodness of my heart. Of course, after listening to all of his hunting and fishing stories, for years, I wanted to go hunting. My father obtained a .410 shotgun from his Cop buddy and we proceeded to go squirrel hunting. I also went bow hunting for deer, that year, with my friends and their father. The next year I was given a 12 ga. single shot shotgun for my 12th birthday, so that I could also go pheasant and rabbit and duck hunting, the following season. I continued to hunt all throughout high school.<br
/> I went pistol shooting, for the first time,  with my other friend and his father, a Detective Sgt., with our city&#8217;s police Juvenile squad, the same year. We shot a 38 Special revolver, a 9mm semi auto and a .22 caliber revolver. My friend also had/has a switchblade collection provided for him, by his father.<br
/> I enlisted in the US Army right out of high school, serving as a Military Policeman. I ended up serving a 4 year Building Trades Apprenticeship, upon my discharge and also acquired a few years of college on top of that, over the years. One of them in the Peace Officer Academy, after which my vocation remained the same, but my new 15 year long avocation was as a volunteer Auxiliary Sheriff&#8217;s Deputy, later a Special Deputy Sheriff which only ended with my becoming disabled, retiring and moving out of State, from the frozen North to the deep South.<br
/> While I no longer hunt, due to infirmity, I still enjoy the shooting sports and have carried a pistol for self defense for decades.<br
/> I am a Constitutional Conservative, who understands that the 2nd Amendment protects all of the rest. It was intended to be the final failsafe for our American Republic. &#8216;A well regulated Militia&#8217;, at the time of the writing of our Constitution meant something different that those same words mean (to some) today. &#8216;Well regulated&#8217;, then, meant &#8216;well trained&#8217; and the General Militia was comprised of all men, from 16 to 60 years of age, excluding only certain political Office holders, who were capable of carrying and being trained to Arms. In fact, if a man could not afford a firearm, he was provided such by the community. Our Founders greatly feared a standing army as a threat to the Republic, even eschewing a &#8216;Select Militia&#8217; (what we, today would refer to as the National Guard or the Reserves) as a threat to our liberties. (Jefferson feared Banking systems as a greater threat and he appears to have been correct)<br
/> Congress reaffirmed our Founder&#8217;s intents, with the passage of the &#8216;Militia Act of 1903&#8242; aka &#8216;The Dick Act&#8217;, which created the &#8216;Unorganized Militia&#8217;, to be comprised of all men, of military age and veterans up to age 60 (considered old age at the time). This Militia was subject to being called upon, by the County Sheriffs and the State&#8217;s Governors, in time of need. This law is still in effect to this day. Thus many who denigrate the possession and use of firearms may well be Militia members, themselves, without even being aware of it.<br
/> Btw, although I have not been to Mexico and never intend to go there, (I have been to South<br
/> Texas numerous times) I was stationed in Germany, whilst in the Army and have been to Canada several times in my life. I never intend to travel outside the USA again, although I have been doing extensive traveling, since I&#8217;ve retired, all across our beautiful country, East to West, and North to South, avoiding of course, those NE States who are illogically hoplophobic and have unconstitutionally restrictive gun ownership laws, as well as being colder than I prefer. Getting old isn&#8217;t so bad, but wearing out sucks.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46205"><p>OK, some of what I&#8217;m going to tell you is true. I&#8217;m an older guy who doesn&#8217;t live in a major city and I don&#8217;t like new things or places. I&#8217;ve never been more than 100 miles away from Utica, New York and I am fond of reading comic books. All in all, I would say that I am less well schooled than that Mark Morford guy who must be pretty smart because he is a writer for a San Francisco newspaper.</p><p>I don&#8217;t get around so well anymore and I doubt that I could hit an intruder with a baseball bat hard enough to stop him. That&#8217;s why I purchased a shotgun and loaded it with 12 gauge, shot shells suitable for hunting geese.  I keep it close by and fully loaded because the kids are grown up and we don&#8217;t get visitors with kids now days.</p><p>I took the shotgun out to shoot tin cans in a quarry down the road. Boy is that thing accurate! I could hit every tin can with every shot at 50 feet! However, I did notice that the trigger was kind of sensitive.</p><p>God forbid that the following scenario ever happens. An intruder breaks into my house and I hear him bumping into things, I don&#8217;t sleep very well these days so even street noises bother me. Did I say that noises in the night make me nervous?<br
/> I also get confused about doing things in the proper sequence when I get stressed, things like calling 911 before I go to investigate night noises.</p><p>Anyway, I saw an intruder and noticed that the his small flashlight beam reflected off something metallic in in his other hand, perhaps a gun. The sound that my gun safety made when I pushed it off, caused the intruder to rush toward me. Was he attacking me or simply trying to get to the broken window nearby?</p><p> We will never know because I somehow put too much pressure on that sensitive trigger. After the ear splitting explosion of my shotgun everything became very quite except for the moaning of the intruder. I then carefully searched the rest of the house to ensure that he had no companions. Some time later I returned to the still alive intruder.</p><p>When I turned the lights on, I could see the terrible damage that the shot charge made in the intruder&#8217;s chest. He is trying to say something so I bent down to better hear. He seems to be both surprised and furious that I shot him. Then he became very still even though his eyes were open.</p><p>I notice the bleeding and retrieved some cleaning rags to minimize the mess. Oh yeah, that&#8217;s when I saw that he was holding a carving knife in his hand, a carving knife from my kitchen cutlery set. I checked his pockets to see if he had any thing else of mine. Then I went to the Kitchen to Make some coffee, I always feel calmer after having a cup.</p><p>While I am drinking the coffee, I remember that I didn&#8217;t call 911, and do so. The police show up about 15 minutes later while I was just finishing my second cup of coffee. The policeman was very understanding about my actions during the attack. He said things like &#8220;You did warn the intruder before you fired the gun, right?&#8221; I told him that to the best of my recollection, I did ask him to reconsider his actions and to think about putting the knife down. And &#8220;You didn&#8217;t mean to kill him, only to disable him so he couldn&#8217;t harm you, right?&#8221; I tell him yes, and that I bought shot shells because they would be less lethal than a hit by a solid slug. He also asked when I called 911. I told him that things happened so fast that I didn&#8217;t have time to use the phone until after things calmed down. The policeman seemed quite pleased with my answers and by then the body was being removed form my house. The understanding police people finally left suggesting that I get some sleep before follow up inquiries and statement on the next day.</p><p>Oh by the way, I was able to whisper something in the intruder&#8217;s ear while he was still conscious. I asked him &#8220;whose your daddy now?&#8221; Hey you&#8217;ve got to have a sense of humor to get through life!</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46444"><p>Russ, Thanks for the reply. As I wrote in my post, some of the information was true and that the outrageous scenario was<br
/> just a scenario.</p><p>Never the less, my purpose in that presentation was to validate why one might wish to enforce his or her Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. A firearm of any type is a true equalizer. A 110 pound woman that was well trained on the use of her 20 gauge shotgun is more than a match for a 220 pound home invader that likes to cause pain and, or death in innocent people.</p><p>Story time. A female instructor at a firearms training facility was having difficulty in getting her female students to understand the concept of self-defense with firearms. Many of the students were only attending these classes at the urging of their boyfriends or husbands. It seemed like the common mentality was that the woman could not face using lethal force on an another human being.</p><p>The instructor finally achieved her goal when she said that there are thugs that will not only abuse women but will do the same and worse to any children that may be in the house. That one message turned the women&#8217;s demeanor into something reminiscent of the behavior of a mother bear with threatened cubs. &#8220;What??? Give me that blasted gun and show me the target!&#8221;</p><p>The inherent right of self-defense is not granted by the government and cannot be denied by the government. Every person has the right to keep and bear a credible means of defense that would give any bad guy pause. If an attacker is unimpressed with the determination of smaller built person holding a firearm, he will quickly lose interest in breathing.</p><p>Innocent victims don&#8217;t kill home invaders, the home invader kill themselves when they press their attacks. Home invaders lose their constitutional rights at the forced door or window. The San Francisco writer is typical of all anti-gun liberals. They are unable to understand a person&#8217;s desire to have a means of defense against brutal thugs that live to kill. Mark<br
/> Morford would have to experience such violence to appreciate the concept of self-defense. Unfortunately, such lessons are always lost on dead victims.</p></div><div

He has his opinion, and as I tell my son &#8220;opinions are like buttholes, everyone has one and pretty much all of them stink&#8221;.  I would say the author is stupid as the writing is indicative of one who is intentionally ignorant.  I am not a Fox supporter, I live in Boulder county Colorado (Boulder is known as 20 square miles surrounded by reality) and I have tools for very different and specific tasks(i.e. firearms) including class 3 stamp holder.  I am of Irish/Scot/Welsh origin, live in a dense urban area, and enjoy theatrical as well as musical (live) productions the latest of which was the Holiday Festival at Macky Auditorium at the University of Colorado campus.  I am an alum of the University and retired from same in 2007.  I am a CCW permit holder and have never entertained the idea of ever harming another human with a firearm or any other weapon.  I have volunteered during my life to helping others including putting my life on the line many times with the volunteer fire department as a firefighter and emt during my tenure with the fire department.  It saddens me to know there are individuals so willing to give themselves over to their anger and ignorance and I sincerely hope the author never becomes a firearms owner.  In closing I am secure in my knowledge and ability to protect myself, my family, and my neighbors.  Good luck with your position Mr. Morford.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46212"><p>Born and raised on a very successful, large, rural diversified agricultural enterprise, mostly orchard and row crops. Graduated high school at 16. Completed my B.Sci. and M.Sci. in animal science at Australia National University in Canberra at 19. Returned to the US went to paramedic training, (30 years, more or less, on the street.), to pay for more graduate school, starting with M.A. in history at CSUC. Worked as a commercial paramedic in Saudi Arabia, Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, Zaire (now Dem. Rep. of Congo) and Tajikistan (For USAID) Ph.D. level research in Holocaust and Genocide Studies in E. Europe (before and after the fall of the USSR), Ph.D. in 1998. Several Post-doc fellowships, including one with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and worked on Holocaust repatriations for the DoJ. Published 3 books about the Holocaust. Spend time in Marseilles on the French Riviera with friends. Speak English, Germany, Polish and French; as well as a little Arabic and Russian. Started, built and sold 3 successful businesses. I&#8217;ve traveled to Fiji; French New Caledonia; Australia; Indonesia; Vietnam; Thailand; India; Hong Kong; Japan; Canada; USSR/Russia; Poland; Lithuania; Jamaica; US Virgin Islands; England; Scotland; France; Germany; Czech Republic; Poland; Italy; and (unfortunately) Croatia. The only places I haven&#8217;t been, that I want to go to, are New Zealand and Antarctica. I only sat down and took a breath in 2007. I&#8217;ve, also, toyed with going to Hungry and Bulgaria, although I probably never will.</p><p>Been shooting since 9 y/o. I, personally, believe that John Browning was one of, if not the, most talented industrial designers in history. The M1911A1 and the M2 are the epitome of his craft. Carl Walther and Ronnie Barrett weren&#8217;t/aren&#8217;t slouches, either. The worst day shooting is better than the best day doing just about anything else.</p><p>I retired to the Intermountain West (Very rural). You can just about count on the fact nearly everybody walks around armed. We live in a firearm culture. We have ZERO CRIME here.</p><p>BTW, I detest the use of the world &#8216;gun&#8217; to describe hand held firearms. A &#8216;gun&#8217; is an artillery piece!</p></div><div

/> I am 68 year old white guy from all over the U.S. currently residing in North Carolina.  B.S in Economics, MS in Business Administration.  I read voraciously &#8211; &#8211; everything from novels, to biographies (Michener, Clancy, Grisham, Buckley, etc.).  I spent 24 years as an Air Force officer and pilot.  Two tours in SEA, and temporary duty in 14 other foriegn countries before retiring in 1994 as a colonel. Then spent 14 years as a dean and vice president at a large community college in NC.  I love golf, woodworking, gardening, motorcycles, kayaking with my wife or grandson, taking care of our 40 acre horse farm, and all kinds of shooting sports.   I own numerous handguns, rifles, and shotguns and reload for all but the .22 caliber plinkers.  I have a concealed carry permit. and occasionally carry.   My wife and 40 yr.old daughter have taken CCW classes and will apply for permits after Christmas.  We have carved out a 125 range on an unused pasture, and I invite friends and neighbors ( black, hispanic, and several self-avowed &#8220;rednecks&#8221;) to join us when we shoot.  We even take food and soft drinks on occasion and &#8220;tailgate&#8221;  &#8211; &#8211; makes a great rural, neighborhood social event.   I have lived in WV, NY, WI, WA, CA, TX, LA, FL, IL CT, AL; and in the suburbs of Chicago, NY City, Spokane, Miami, St. Louis, and Milwaukee.   I currently live midway between Greensboro and Charlotte, NC, near a plethora of good colleges and universities.  I have a consulting business specializing in aviation training and education.    I don&#8217;t quite fit the Morford stereotype, and upon reflection neither do most of my range and shooting friends.   I own guns for several reasons that are very important to me.  First, because I believe in personal freedoms and a small government that allows those freedoms to exist.  Secondly, because I believe it is my responsibility to protect myself and those freedoms.  I live in a rural area, and have been told by the Sheriff (whom I helped elect), that they cannot respond quickly enough to help me or my family in a life-threatening situation.   Almost as importantly, I love the precision and beauty of a good firearm &#8211; &#8211; same as I do a good woodworking tool.  I love the sense of accomplishment when I fashion a really accurate load for a rifle or handgun.  I take great pride in hitting a 7-iron stiff from 150-160 yards &#8211; &#8211; same as I do when I shoot a 1-2&#8243; group with a revolver from 25 yards.    I used to hunt, but no longer do.   Could, if I needed to put food on the table though.    I have a couple of good neighbors &#8211; &#8211; and friends &#8212; who model some of the characteristics described by the &#8220;ass clown&#8221; (we call them country boys,)  but it appears he has taken all the qualities he finds most objectionable in the Americans he abhors, and has lumped them together to form what he calls a &#8220;typical, scared, white gun owner.&#8221;  I, and my friends are proud gun owners who don&#8217;t fit this mold, and are even prouder to also not fit the bubble of predjudiced stupidity that Morford lives in.</p></div><div

And people wonder why there&#8217;s such an identity theft problem.<br
/> Rules used to be simple and the smart ones stuck to them. One very common rule was to keep your private life private. If someone would goat another into giving up personal information in the manner this article does &#8220;prove you are not what we say you are&#8221; it was often answered with &#8220;Who&#8217;s asking?&#8221; the response was always &#8220;Never heard of you!&#8221;. The response was always that because if the first question needed said obviously the response was as well.</p><p>For those who haven&#8217;t learned this lesson, what info you gave here thinking your debunking the claim is more than enough for another to steal your identity.</p><p>No one needs to know your private affairs especially on line to people unknown who will never be met.</p><p>Go ahead and try and call me paronoid, see the above for my response. It&#8217;s just common sense.</p></div><div

/> Maybe more liberal/socialist/communist will follow, and we&#8217;ll all be better off because of it.<br
/> Some of us don&#8217;t mind being open about ourselves and have to do it to get a CCWL, and are by nature prepared for bad people trying to take advantage.<br

Yeah! Fun? Definitely! I also keep and carry handguns for protection. I did NOT go out and by a gun on Black Friday.

I resent anyone lumping me in with their conception of what the typical anyone is.</p><p>I doubt those who make statements such as Mr. Morford are all a bunch of elitist snobs who refuse to recognize any one who does not share their view on the world. Their minds are closed to anything which doesn&#8217;t conform to their preconceived notion of what is correct.

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46256"><p>Declaring our education credentials is sort of letting the silly person define the terms. I don&#8217;t mind agreeing with them to a degree. Scaed? &#8230;well&#8230; to a degree sure. When I get in my car I&#8217;m scared. I pay attention and take reasonable precautions to avaoid tragedy tha is just an attention span and two painted stripes away from happening. Big danger lurks yet can be fairly well mitigated by paying attention. So I&#8217;ll accepted scared and suggest that it is better than naive and clueless.<br
/> Black people within 200 miles? Well, maybe not all black people and not necessarily a full 200 miles away but there are neighborhoods near me that are a disaster. I wouldn&#8217;t let my wife or daughter stroll around the block while I looked for a parking spot. Those neighborhoods are typically devoid of a white face except my own at those moments. Considering how popular riotous lynch mob behavior and reasoning has been among that group I would say it is reasonable to be scared. Unless you know a more effective way to turn a lynch-mob-mentality person into a reasonable I&#8217;ll keep deadly force handy.<br
/> As for the value of education; well education seems to be a dubious thing. I would trust a description of someone labeled &#8216;has common sense&#8221; or &#8220;reasonable&#8221; as being a better descriptor of what to expect of a person than if a person was referred to as &#8220;well educated&#8221;.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46262"><p>I am a 55 year old male of Polish, Prussian, English, French (Canadian), German, Gypsy, and Irish heritage.  I am a full blooded New England born and raised Yankee however.  Cheap and frugal to a fault. I have an Associates in Business Administration.  I created and ran a manufacturing company for 10 years.  I worked for the Department of Labor for a while. I now work as a Stationary Engineer (It has nothing to do with paper or greeting cards) at a Major State University at their medical school.  I have owned guns since I was 9.  I used to hunt but I don&#8217;t like killing things so I&#8217;ve given that up.  I have used a gun outside the home to defend myself against people twice. I have used a gun to defend myself against a dangerous animal twice.  I have used a gun to defend my home and family half a dozen times. The only shots fired were killing a rabid skunk while hiking and scaring off a pit bull that attacked my neighbor&#8217;s 120lb husky.  I enjoy shooting because it is a sport that forces you to learn about yourself. It helps learn self discipline. Being and engineer I am also fascinated with the incredible engineering that goes into gun design. I enjoy reloading to the extent of loading nearly all of the 12,000 rounds I shoot at the range annually.  The things that anger me most about the anti gunners is the lies they tell, the statistics they make up as they go along, and the fact that they keep demanding laws that already exist.</p></div><div

I work in Raleigh, NC. Ironically, I have only been to Mexico but would love to travel more. I play tennis and read A LOT, because I like it. I only tell this part to further dispel the myth from that ridiculous article&#8230;My sister is mixed (white mother/black father) and I consider her dad and his family part of my family. When my husband and I seperated, he gave me a gun for protection, because I&#8217;d be living alone. I wanted to be a responsible gun owner so I learned to handle a gun safely and to shoot accurately. I now enjoy shooting at targets for fun. Just like the author of this article, I will not consider the color of a person&#8217;s skin if they are threatening to harm me or my children. I will only see the threat and take appropriate action.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46285"><p>Swedish-born black male (with one parent from &#8220;each camp&#8221;, white Swedish mother, black American father), dual citizen since birth, brought up in a socialist environment, did my compulsory military service in Sweden, eventually moved to the US. Was never really interested in firearms until 5 years ago when I started working as a contractor for the Department of Defense and worked next to an outdoor range made available to civilians. Still affected by my hoplophobic upbringing, I realized that I had never shot a pistol. In short order I took an NRA intro course and tried my hands on marksmanship and shooting&#8230; and loved it. In short order I got my first Glock, started buying German made Sigs on auctions, acquired a Mossberg, a Remington, and an AK 47 &#8212; some classics. I&#8217;m yet to get a proper AR 15 but I might wait until I move away from California. I have since acquired many other firearms and enjoy them all. Becoming a gun owner came with a price and some &#8220;friends&#8221; stopped talking to me and unfriended me on Facebook, when I engaged in rational fact based commentary during the height of the anti-gun hoopla a few years ago. Essentially all of my friends up until that point were socialist big government nanny state proponents who frown upon independence, personal ownership and responsibility. Now I&#8217;ve expanded my friendship base to include patriots, Veterans, independent thinkers, libertarians and conservatives, Black, White, Chicanos and Asians. Although uneducated from the perspective that I don&#8217;t have any degrees, I&#8217;ve worked myself up to a 6-figure salary doing IT engineering and systems work all over the world, now as a contractor for the US Navy in a research facility, and previsouly in in Silicon Valley. I speak 6 languages, I&#8217;ve visited 4 continents, I&#8217;ve lived on 4 countries, and I&#8217;ve visited 35-40 countries, I&#8217;m married to a hot Black aerospace engineer so I must have done something right :). I just purchased a pink airgun to our 6 year old daughter and I want to teach her firearms safety from an early age, with the hope that she grows up to become a responsible gun owner and practices her 2nd Amendment Right. God Bless the USA.</p></div><div

To get straight to the point, either Canisius College is a dime sore diploma dispenser or you are the kind of knuckle head the article you are tearing apart is talking about.  The fact that you don&#8217;t seem to know the proper use of THAN instead of THEN, is one indication.  The generally poor writing is further confirmation.  Gun owners probably are not lowbrows, but you certainly don&#8217;t make the case for that fact.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46298"><p>Have NEVER seen so many responses to a topic!</p><p>My 2 cents worth: I do somewhat fit the profile of gun owners by that SF liberal columnist. White redneck in Arkansas, blue-collar to the core. I&#8217;m old now but was pretty much the same since my twenties. I once was a scared wimpy teenager being raised by a scared wimpy liberal social worker father who absolutely demanded that I would go to college, although everything I thought I might like doing for a living involved a trade. But hey, that&#8217;s what liberals do, right?  They insist they know what is best for you and your life. I decided the cure for my fears and wimpiness and control by my father was to enlist in the Marines. Did so, and all my father&#8217;s letters to his Congressman could not get me out. Did a tour in Viet Nam as a grunt, and got out of the Corps with the realization that I was no longer a scared wimp, but as tough and fearless as most people I&#8217;m likely to run across. Then, because I had GI Bill and no more need to rebel against my father, I went to college, got a degree, and tried teaching school &#8220;because helping people is more noble than working with one&#8217;s hands.&#8221;  HATED it!</p><p>I returned to my blue collar interests. Enjoyed painting cars and trucks, running the paint department of a hardware store, working as a mechanic in a couple of factories, doing lawn maintenance and landscaping. Had my own body shop for a while, operated a lawn service for about 14 years.  Never got wealthy partly because of a stubborn emphasis on doing really good work when I might have got by with slipshop.</p><p>Much more importantly, raised a son&#8211;well maybe my wife did more of it than I&#8211;who never had any interest in drugs or sexual promiscuity, who now makes better than decent living as an IT manager and has two great kids of his own. But I have 2 sisters who followed my father&#8217;s liberal philosophies, including lack of personal responsibility, experimentation with whatever felt good regardless of law or conventional mores, and the idea that people&#8217;s failures are never their own fault but happen because of oppression by the &#8220;rich&#8221; and religion. Only one of the four of my sisters&#8217; sons are self-supporting in their mid-thirties.</p><p>My father hated guns; eventually I decided I like military rifles enough to give up other hobbies and acquire a decent collection. No doubt many in my family regard me as a dangerous nut even though I&#8217;ve never pointed a firearm at anyone since Viet Nam. Not to say I would have any problem with that. If some thug puts me in a position to believe it&#8217;s going to be either him or me (or any other decent person who happens to be involved) I will do my best to insure the thug gets what he has asked for.</p><p>I&#8217;m retirement age but will probably continue in my factory job another 3 or 4 years. I am one of those fundamental Christians, not rabid about it, but understand I am a sinner who will only see heaven because God loves me and forgives me through the sacrifice Jesus made for my guilt. That makes me narrow-minded in the eyes of some. It might surprise them to know I also believed Christianity was narrow-minded myth until about 20 years ago. The TV in our home is rarely on an hour a week, I don&#8217;t read either conservative or liberal blogs very often, the little reading I have time for is the newspaper, a Christian news magazine, and National Geographic. Plenty of diversity of viewpoints in that selection. I don&#8217;t carry, although I&#8217;ve thought about getting the permit. But anyone who intends to victimize me will discover some folks are well-armed even without a visible weapon.</p><p>And this is way too long, so I&#8217;ll quit.</p></div><div

I have packed a gun all my adult life, never out of fear. I have met very few fearful people buying a gun. Those people with genuine fear were often victims of domestic violence or a stalker. Being fearful, doesn&#8217;t mean ones fear is unreasonable. Like being a paranoid, if you have a sound basis for being paranoid, that is not a wrong position to hold.<br
/> Anti-gunners fear people with guns, and project their fear onto others. I get a kick out of those that say, &#8220;If I had a gun, I would shoot that so and so&#8221;. Usually over something that would not justify using a gun. Those people actually think the gun would make them do dumb things.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46306"><p>45 year old white male, BA in History, MA in Public History. I live in a major metropolitan area in the Southeast, work for a Fortune 500 company.  I probably have read a lot of more complicated non-fiction than the (I assume fiction) that the author of the article reads. I&#8217;ve travelled to at least 10 different countries on 4 continents, and not all of them developed. I&#8217;ve been a medieval re-enactor and a SCUBA instructor, not sure where the author&#8217;s threshold for liking weird things starts but I bet I can qualify. I&#8217;m not a big fan of Fox News, though I do watch it on occasion to get a different viewpoint. I get most of my news online or from NPR. I haven&#8217;t watched TV with any regularity for years; I stay too busy to find time for it. I shoot for fun, sport, because it&#8217;s part of my family tradition and heritage that I enjoy, and to put meat in the freezer. I have a CCW for the same reason I have fire extinguishers and smoke alarms in my house. I&#8217;m not particularly paranoid or fearful about anything. Nobody is rioting or looting in my neighborhood; all my LE neighbors (local, state and federal) make for a quiet and safe neighborhood. I&#8217;ve grown up around firearms, they are familiar tools (as well as an interesting slice of history), and because they are familiar and I was taught proper firearms safety I have no fear of them as objects. I can understand where the combination of unfamiliarity and propaganda has led some other people to the opposite end of the comfort spectrum.</p></div><div

My husband is a high-level corporate executive who insisted that I learn to shoot and start carrying when I was taking my horses to forest preserves with other ladies for trail riding.  Two decades later, we both have our concealed carry permits and are very proficient at the range.  I have traveled throughout Italy, Belgium, France, Mexico, and the United States, primarily for work.  I am well-educated, well-read, and politically conservative, though open-minded with respect to women&#8217;s rights and other people&#8217;s choices regarding whom they would like to marry.  I vehemently despise hunting and the killing of animals.  But, I strongly believe in my right to defend myself.  I particularly love my H&amp;K P30 and Sig P238.  And, I bought another Sig on Black Friday.  When anyone is surprised to learn of my position on gun rights, I just ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s your plan?  What exactly are you going to do when someone breaks into your house or walks into this business with a gun?  If just one of those ladies at Lane Bryant had been carrying, perhaps some of the women could have been saved.&#8221;  In 51 years I haven&#8217;t shot anyone yet, although I am fully prepared to do so if necessary to defend my family or myself.  Being prepared is what a responsible, educated, intelligent, self-reliant American does.</p></div><div

I have traveled all over the world, from UK to New Zealand, studied abroad, grew up in a family with both parents in medicine, and have friends from all sides of political views, careers, etc.  Up until a couple years ago I had never hunted or carried a shotgun in my life.

Most of my friends that are female are now starting to come to me to ask about getting into hunting, shooting, going to the gun club &#8211; interested in both handguns and shotguns.  Not one of them has mentioned anything about their reason being because they are &#8220;scared&#8221;,  It is fun, social, challenging &#8211; takes skill to learn how to shoot well out at the club or hunting.  Those are my reasons.</p></div><div

I have an AA with concentration on Political Science that I earned while working mid-night shift, going to school three days a week, and coaching baseball another three days in the week.  I live just a few yards outside the city limits of the largest city in the South and only a few miles from Georgia Tech and Georgia State.  It&#8217;s a few miles further to the University of Georgia (GO DAWGS).  I&#8217;ve never been to Mexico although I lived in South Texas for two years.   I have however seen the inside of Knoth and Newgrange.  I&#8217;ve walked the streets in the ruins of Athens and I&#8217;ve watched the sun set over the Acropolis.  I read Dumas, Hugo, Sophocles and Twain.  Shakespeare, Heinlein, Asimov and Clancy.  My grandfather taught me to shoot when I was six.  I agree with Twain that &#8220;golf is a pleasant walk in the country, ruined.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t like trying to put a little ball in a hole a few hundred yards away but I do enjoy punching holes in paper at long distances.</p></div><div

BS Mechanical Engineering, gainfully employed and work hard at keeping other people employed in a diminishing manufacturing economy.  I use firearms to hunt and shoot recreationally and have done so since I was about 5 years old.  I watch news everyday from a variety of balanced sources, but like another writer, prefer to watch ESPN.  I am an avid college football fan and this is my favorite time of year.  It is football and hunting season.  I am from Florida and have lived in major metropolitan areas in all the &#8220;C&#8221; states since graduating college.  That would be California, Connecticut, and Colorado.  Not exactly hotbed centers for illiterate, racist, ignorant white guys.  Then again maybe I am being delusional.</p></div><div

Bachelors of Science in Microbiology (Dean&#8217;s List) and multiple Master&#8217;s, all paid for in cash by me working &#8211; no federal handout loans or parental charity. Working and paying taxes since I was 13 years old. Never took drugs, broke the law or participated in any aberrant sexual behavior. Served in the US Coast Guard for over a decade because it&#8217;s about saving lives, not destroying them.<br
/> I live in the suburbs because I make a lot of money and can afford to own a car instead of riding in a bus or smelly cab. Six figure salary for managing a laboratory of 17 people for the largest pharmaceutical company in the world and spend some of my vacation days as a 2 thousand dollar a day consultant. I have travelled to many countries, sometimes on less than 4 hours notice to solve problems others could not. I do not read complicated books, but people who do, think I should write one. I don&#8217;t have time to watch television.<br
/> I learned to shoot in the Boy Scouts and owned my first shotgun at 15. I paid for it with the money I earned working on a trap range. I even reloaded my own shells. I was a classified competitor in rifle, pistol and shotgun and while I never won enough to retire, I have won my class in some competitions and got enough to pay my expenses. In my spare time I am a State Police Certified Firearms Instructor and have trained well over 100 people in over 60 classes to get their licenses to carry concealed. One of my clients was almost strangled by her boyfriend, another owned one of the largest law firms in Boston and regularly had their life threatened on the outcome of cases.<br
/> I don&#8217;t like new things like rewriting the US Constitution or complete immunity from prosecution for abuse of the first amendment by Morford. I&#8217;m kind of old fashion that way.<br
/> I believe the person who wrote that op-ed piece should have his personal address and phone numbers, email addresses and photograph publicized so he can face the people he attacks on a daily basis. Perhaps facing millions and millions of people who don&#8217;t agree with him in an endless argument he can never win will drive him underground or at least out of the public eye until he grows a spine.</p></div><div

/> All the firearm enthusiast I&#8217;ve ever come across have had the best human qualities of any class of people , and are a pleasure to be around.<br
/> Honest<br
/> Courteous<br
/> Thankful<br
/> Helpful<br
/> Calculating<br
/> Virtuous<br
/> Brave<br
/> Funny<br
/> Intelligent</p><p>It&#8217;s good to see some backgrounds to past writings I&#8217;ve seen posted here.</p><p>Here&#8217;s me; 55 years, born and raised in Southern California.<br
/> Ethnicity; German, Irish, Scottish, Portuguese, Bohemian, Spanish ( a mutt )<br
/> I come from a long line of teachers and school district employees.<br
/> My wife and kids are carrying on that tradition as well.<br
/> I&#8217;m the middle child of 8 kids, all surfers ,skiers, hunters, swimmers, bikers, mariners and athletes.<br
/> Training includes; Veterinarian, Lifeguard, Botanist, Herpetologist, Construction, Sales, Management and a Entrepreneur for the most part. My latest venture being &#8220;Gunsmithing&#8221; and design. Got to keep up with Californians 2A infringements<br
/> Been shooting since 11 yrs old.<br
/> I have grown up with, and have been around all races my whole life, and can care less what color you are.<br
/> People don&#8217;t scare me, but uneducated people who actually think they know what they&#8217;re talking about but lack facts, piss me off a little.<br
/> Especially people that are trying to divide our country by race baiting.<br
/> Enemies to America like Obama, Holder, Jackson, Sharpton, Farrakhan and all the white guilt appeasers.<br
/> Especially the talking heads of the leftist socialist media that will not tell you what&#8217;s really going on.<br
/> FOX news will. But even they don&#8217;t show you everything. So you need to do your own homework.<br
/> I&#8217;m a guy who has watched California go from conservative to socialist to the point that I&#8217;m willing to leave. CA has gotten to be more dangerous with the influx of gangs, bums, and foreigners.<br
/> All having their hands out for whatever they can get for free.<br
/> I&#8217;ve watched schools turn politically correct to the point of losing freedom of speech.<br
/> And convert to bilingual so as to costing twice as much to educate.<br
/> Pretty much all those Hippys that were all around as I was a kid, are running things now here.<br
/> I see how they pass laws to chisel away at my second amendment rights to make it so I can&#8217;t have what the rest of America enjoys.<br
/> And so that makes me want to buy whatever guns and ammo I can right now before it&#8217;s too late.<br
/> But shooting for me at the moment is fun, exciting and very interesting<br
/> It&#8217;s giving me a chance to meet real genuinely cool people who I consider to be true Americans.</p><p>Guys like the one&#8217;s S.H. Blannelberry talks about in this article are not worth my time.<br
/> I can only tell them to learn History before they speak, so as to not offend me with their smug ignorance and pomposity.<br
/> I also see them as those &#8220;zombies&#8221; everyone talks about, and feel they will be the first to go in a SHTF circumstance. All being their fault, I couldn&#8217;t care less about them.<br
/> Sorry if I sound hardened by my law of the jungle attitude. But the dumbest people with the smartest phones are all around me walking into pole, each other and have passed the drunks up in car accidents with their texting. I&#8217;m a bit numb from them. End of rant. Thanks for letting me vent.<br
/> It&#8217;s good to know you guys/gals</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-46373"><p>48 year old full-blood Puerto Rican lawyer, born in upstate New York and raised and lived in Detroit, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Ohio, the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Florida, the California inland deserts and now Texas. Guess some might label me an &#8220;ethnic minority.&#8221; Lived a somewhat sheltered life as the son of an Army doctor drafted during Vietnam and who later retired as a full-bird Colonel in the Air Force. Along with my Dad as one of my greatest heroes, I also looked up to my Uncle Juan, who served as a Marine in the Pacific during WWII and survived several first landings and the Battles of Guadalcanal and Okinawa. There&#8217;s also my Uncle Billy, a Marine who survived the siege at Khe Sanh, my Step-grandpa Guilo and my Uncle Manolo, both of whom fought in Korea with the famed all-Puerto Rican 65th Infantry. I remember my Uncle Juan and my Uncle Manolo never wanting to talk about their war experiences, much less own or even touch a gun. And my Dad, a doctor who saw gun-shot wounds while doing his rotation as a resident in the emergency room, didn&#8217;t want guns in the house. So I never grew up with guns, but I did grow up with a healthy respect for our military. Fortunately, my Dad has since changed and now owns and enjoys shooting his guns.</p><p>After graduating law school and passing the bar, I tried to follow in my family&#8217;s footsteps by joining the military, the JAG to be more specific. Every branch of the military rejected me due to the military downsizing during the Clinton years. So I went a different route and ended up working as an INS Trial Attorney handling the civil prosecution in Immigration Court of alien smuggling, drug trafficking and criminal alien processing cases. That work opened my mind to the real dangers of our society and the violence of a world I was mostly sheltered from while growing up, with the exception of the incessant crime we saw when I spent some years growing up in Puerto Rico. It was no comfort when told I had a price on my head from one of the Mexican drug cartels by the time I left the INS and switched federal agencies. I now work and live in Texas and have since obtained my CHL.</p><p>My first foray into guns was when I was with my high school friends while my Dad was stationed in Mississippi. Being an outsider, and a Puerto Rican one at that, I didn&#8217;t have too many local friends, but most folks were friendly and a few even invited me to go hunting with them. I thoroughly enjoyed that experience, especially the target shooting aspect my friends introduced to me.</p><p>I now own a few guns, most of which I enjoy for target shooting. However, I also own them to defend my family, my self and my home if needed although I hope I&#8217;ll never need them for that purpose. Although I lean politically to the left on some causes, I also lean politically right on a few others, with the issue of the 2nd Amendment being one that I staunchly believe in. I believe one of the main purposes of the 2nd Amendment&#8217;s is to allow each citizen the right to defend him/herself. That could be from a criminal intent on attacking and causing harm to a rabid dog attacking your child or a rattlesnake coiled up and poised to strike. I also believe that our country has a strong, cultural heritage with guns and, like Brad Pitt says, it&#8217;s in our DNA so to speak. This is evident in the popularity of TV shows like &#8220;Duck Dynasty,&#8221; the hunting seasons each State offers, and the many target shooting matches and tournaments scheduled throughout the year and all over our country.</p><p>It&#8217;s a shame articles like the one published in the SF Gate stereotype gun owners. When I took my CHL class here in Texas, applicants like myself were made up of all walks of life, and in all colors, shapes, sizes and gender. The lady in the shooting lane next to me was a young African-American with little experience shooting a gun but wanted to a CHL to defend herself as did everyone else in our CHL class. I think if someone were to take the SF Gate author shooting and teach him not only the safety aspects of handling a gun but also about the target shooting aspect of the sport, he may just change his mind somewhat and see that gun owners are not as stereotypical as he thought.</p></div><div

I have owned weapons (pistols, revelver&#8217;s, shot guns, rifles) sense I was of legal age to purchase and had the money to do so. I have never been arrested, put in jail or been to prison. I graduated for from high school and went on to college (WMU) earning a BA in management. Attended one of the better East Coast maritime Academies but, ran out of money. I did have enough time to wright for ratings on my MMA document which allowed me to become a (QMED) quilified member of the engine department. I have traveled throught the United States visiting at least 30 or the 50 states. I have also traveled across the big pond and tot he islands. We have three family farms ranging frome small, medium to very large. We do a lot of farming; along with hunting and fishing. I make my own fishing jigs and dress (Tie) my own fishing hooks. I poor the lead for the jigs and in the future hope to be pooring lead to make my own bullets. The article is what it is. Word written by someone who does not want to take personal responsiblility for their own life if they had too. As my buddy likes to say &#8220;everybody digs something&#8221; and his writing takes a shot (pund) ane what we dig. I like what you had to say. I also don&#8217;t like carjackers, looters, thugs, gungsters and most of all people that harm or take advantage of older people. I hope that people who read the article and words that you wrote to heart. I am tired of going onto gun related web sites and blogs and looking at the poster call people thugs and gangsters. You are doing the same thing as the person wrote the article. Sorry, this gun owner, purchaser, ccw/cpl holder does not fit the profile.</p></div><div

(except while in diapers)  I&#8217;ve never hurt anybody&#8230; cept that Boy with the ear ring and that was an accident, I Swear! I didn&#8217;t think My B.B. gun was even cocked, really&#8230; it&#8217;s the Truth!  I apologised for stinging His hind-end after I got Mine stung pretty good but I still aint Scared of anybody or anything cept maybe FLOTUS and if She don&#8217;t scare You&#8230; well, You are one Bad Cat cause some of Her faces are Horrifying!  I am a little curious as to just why We should feel the need to explain Ourselves to a Lily-Livered Communist from the Left Coast that doesn&#8217;t even believe in the Constitution of Our Great Country or that there are People in it that are worth protecting from Danger or Harm with Our Brains, Brawn &amp; Weaponry even to Our final breath. You see, some People only Care about themselves so They would only need a gun if They were using it on Themself and that&#8217;s why They would Never get one and why They don&#8217;t want Us to have one either. If there are No Guns, these Jackasses will never have to shoot themselves&#8230;   SIMPLE.</p></div><div

I am not an educated person.  indeed my last completed grade was the 8th grade.  I come from your classic broken home and had a very turbulent childhood.  I mention all this because I am living proof that a person can rise from their circumstances and become a productive part of society and the leader of a household.  my income range is moderate at around 70k a year.  I own several firearms and enjoy shooting.  I also like the idea of being able to defend myself and my family.  I believe the second amendment is not about sport or hunting.  it is about being able to defend yourself, your community and your country from all enemies foreign or domestic.</p><p>I find many times that people who are against guns are very short sighted and are willing to give up their liberties and strip others of their liberties for feel good laws that do absolutely nothing to resolve any of society&#8217;s ills.</p></div><div

I consider myself to be well read and watch the news all of it or as I like to call it the nightly blues.  Everyday someone shoots some one 25 or less miles from my home. I live near two big cities and it scares the hell out of me to think that one of my grandchildren or family members could be in the wrong spot at the wrong time and fall victim to a killer. As my O.D. said I never killed anyone that didn&#8217;t need to be killed. I believe that with my whole heart. I want to be ready; willing; and able to take care of a bad situation if it happens. You don&#8217;t like guns to bad for you but if bad happens to a loved one its no ones fault but you anti gun nuts in the world. Sorry but that&#8217;s the cross you have to bear. All alone!</p></div><div

To old to roam the woods alone hunting deer. I slapped the crap out of a punk in New York city a week ago. He started it, my wife agreed, never get in a revolving door and call a old man an old piece of s==t who just happens to be in there first.  This could be applied to the SF sweet boy and change his outlook on his fellow man. I&#8217;m kind of a Democrat and Republican. But, I am definitely a southern man.

I&#8217;m currently reading Stephen King&#8217;s Mercedes Man on my Kindle Fire while I contemplate going outside and tackling the new snow with my trusty snowblower.</p><p>I used to target shoot quite a lot in my 20&#8217;s but drifted away from it for reasons I can&#8217;t remember. Got back into target shooting when I retired and I now shoot once a week, weather permitting. I do not hunt. I used to shoot exclusively with .22 caliber rifles and pistols up until this year, when I added a DA .357/38 revolver, a .357/38 lever action Henry rifle and a.223 Ruger American to the gun cabinet. Now I reload the large calibers and l thoroughly enjoy target shooting with all of them.</p><p>I don&#8217;t carry concealed but I do have a couple of guns hidden in the house to defend against burglars and home invaders. Am I scared that those things might happen to me? No. I consider cached guns inside the house to be prudent insurance.</p><p> So I&#8217;m pretty sure I don&#8217;t fit your ass clowns description as a scared white man for buying guns. I buy them because I like them and I like to shoot them.</p></div><div

I have a BA in Criminal Justice from the University of Maryland, and an MS in Management from Johns Hopkins Uniiversity. I am multilingual and have been all over the world, to include China (3 times), South Korea, and yes, Mexico. I have been a member of a major, east coast police department for nearly 32 years, and have been a captain for nearly 16 of those years. Most importantly, I respect the Constitution of the United States, and believe that the 2nd Ammendment gives all American the right to keep and bear arms. Your choice is not up to me, and my choice is NOT UP TO YOU. As one of the previous commenters said, I think that alot of Americans take their constitutional rights for granted. A gun is a tool, no better or worse than the PERSON handling it. I carry almost every time I leave my house, not just for my own protection, but because I feel that with my expereince and training, I have an obligation to protect others, should the need arise. I wonder how many gun control zealots would be shocked to know that standing in line next to them in the grocery store, or sitting near them in the movie threater, that the middle aged white guy, is armed and willing to protect them, should the need arise.</p></div><div

I am afraid of anyone of any color that would do harm to me, family, or my country. I love to be outdoors, fishing, hunting, shooting, hiking, biking, or anything else that takes me away from the norm. I am also an Eagle Scout and try to do a good turn daily. I just wish I would have served in the Marines when age permitted.</p></div><div

Your basic put brain in gear before putting mouth in motion rule did not apply on this article.  I am a 67 year old (don&#8217;t know how that happened!), have a BS in business administration, live within a few minutes of Ohio State University as well as other fine community colleges, watch very little TV, read, like most people and own several guns. I have been out of state and country thanks to the US Army (1967-1975 unpopular time).  I have been shooting since I was about ten and immediately knew I found something I wanted to keep doing because of the challenge.  So far, none of the pistols or rifles I own have shot any one and I pray they never have to.  I am about this crazy about this country of ours.  What is wrong with exercising our Second Amendment Rights?  If this goes odds are the rest shall follow.  Our fore fathers wrote from experience so that we could enjoy the freedoms they fought so hard for.  Unfortunately, we have to put up with this type of misrepresentation.</p></div><div

The last nine years I have taught at not only a tech school but a community college. I served 6 yrs. in the National Guard. I had guns before I joined the guard, but really started to enjoy shooting after I joined. We need to protect ALL our rights and to do that we absolutely need 2A. Not giving up mine. I keep up on politics and have since I was just in high school, so not sure what kind of &#8220;education&#8221; you need to hate guns and blame them for crime. I guess the liberal college profs usually convert naive young minds and are not happy when they cannot.</p></div><div

Well read in wide variety of literature including the classics.  Love to shoot, hunt (beginning to lose my zeal for harvesting, but still do from time to time), hike, fish, etc.  Travelled twice to Europe; mainland western Europe 1st time, British Isles the 2d.  Several trips to Mexico including some short-term work there.  Former Marine and served during Desert Storm.  Lived three years in the Seattle area, two years in the San Diego area, three years in Anchorage, AK, and five years in Boise, ID.  My highest IQ score ever was 137, lowest ever was 89 ;)&#8230;ouch.  When I took IQ tests, most of my scores were in the 115-125 range.  I don&#8217;t carry anymore.  Guess I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d shoot some ignorant wretch of a criminal and live to regret it.  I do enjoy marksmanship and reloading, tactical and survival training though!</p></div><div

An anti gun fanatic is like all fanatics, i liken them to religious fanatics, living with blinders on and closed brains.  if one looks deep, they are very insecure and not too intelligent, the fears and phobias, and the closed minds prevent any personal growth or learning.  So, I love to play the part of the poor old dumb ass country boy, keep a low profile and they never see me coming, a good defensive tool when your opponent has misconceptions about who he is facing&#8211;i also study krav magda, just to be able to disable anyone, me, a 61 year old &#8220;old man&#8221;, try to not fight, as i am training to disable and do permanent damage, not fight.  I believe nothing any official tells me, i research the truth, not the spin and lies.  So, people like the author noted are dealt with as flies, just an irritant, and a prime example of the stupid people, and there are plenty, we have to deal with daily.  I do not watch any tv news, all comes from my experts commentaries and my own research, which one learns in dealing with the governments over 35 plus years, along with the legal research related thereto, i also had a double major, accounting and statistics, i totally understand the manipulation of numbers to reach a desired outcome as &#8220;proof&#8221;, right now i hold very few dollars, every extra over bills goes to silver, palladium, graphite, and some related stocks, as well as land and firearms and ammo, inflation assets for the long term, during the last tech bust, most of my clients lost 1/2 of their wealth, the real estate bust is still killing the small investor, and we are in one of the fastest growing counties in the us.  One of my clients is the CEO of a large company that moved their operations from california to mexico, regulations and taxes.  I am amazed at the stupid people elected, it is all about the money, and anything will be promised to get them to the golden land of politics and their masters, the big business interests (all relative to the political position, from mayor to senator), as to race, i played football with some of the first black guys integrated into our high school in the late 60&#8217;s, they are still my friends, and we have discussed the lack of hope for most young blacks locked into the ghetto&#8217;s, they are in survival mode, no options, for all the money the government throws at them (or their families) they have no method of gaining self respect other than violence, no way to make money other than drugs and sex, no hope, we have failed them by creating a system that enables them, what will they do when that system collapses (like the 13trillion used to fund welfare) some need help due to circumstance, but i believe in teaching them to fish, rather than just give them fish (stolen concept from bible and and most other major social historical references, i borrow it here, not my original words, but i totally understand the common sense truth)  so they are raised in a multi generation history of handouts filled with fraud and abuse, it is always about the money, the power of the wealthy. When, not if , the shit hits the fan, the wealthy will be gone from the line of fire, just leaving us 99% ers to deal with it.  Be a boy scout, or just a smart human, be prepared, and knowledge is key to preparation,   expect the best, but be ready for the worst.  Dumb fanatics should have to take a test before being allowed to give public comments, but that would limit the number of politicians we have.  Better yet, drop the author into the ghettos of chicago, or any major city, no gun, he hates them, and pick him up in a year, if he is alive.  best education is experience, lets get these thinkers exposed to the real world.  just an irritant, not really worth the response here, but may open some eyes or ears, i hope, live well and fearless, we are only here for a flash, in the grand scheme of things, enjoy your life, ignore the assholes, and have fun, my only rule is do no harm and never do what i would not want done to me, like massive lies perpetrated by our &#8220;leadership&#8221;.  All the responses on here show what reality is, not the numbnuts writing.</p></div><div

I am amazed at the stupid people elected, it is all about the money, and anything will be promised to get them to the golden land of politics and their masters, the big business interests (all relative to the political position, from mayor to senator), as to race, i played football with some of the first black guys integrated into our high school in the late 60&#8217;s, they are still my friends, and we have discussed the lack of hope for most young blacks locked into the ghetto&#8217;s, they are in survival mode, no options, for all the money the government throws at them (or their families) they have no method of gaining self respect other than violence, no way to make money other than drugs and sex, no hope, we have failed them by creating a system that enables them, what will they do when that system collapses (like the 13trillion used to fund welfare) some need help due to circumstance, but i believe in teaching them to fish, rather than just give them fish (stolen concept from bible and and most other major social historical references, i borrow it here, not my original words, but i totally understand the common sense truth)  so they are raised in a multi generation history of handouts filled with fraud and abuse, it is always about the money, the power of the wealthy. When, not if , the shit hits the fan, the wealthy will be gone from the line of fire, just leaving us 99% ers to deal with it.  Be a boy scout, or just a smart human, be prepared, and knowledge is key to preparation,   expect the best, but be ready for the worst.  Dumb fanatics should have to take a test before being allowed to give public comments, but that would limit the number of politicians we have.  Better yet, drop the author into the ghettos of chicago, or any major city, no gun, he hates them, and pick him up in a year, if he is alive.  best education is experience, lets get these thinkers exposed to the real world.  just an irritant, not really worth the response here, but may open some eyes or ears, i hope, live well and fearless, we are only here for a flash, in the grand scheme of things, enjoy your life, ignore the assholes, and have fun, my only rule is do no harm and never do what i would not want done to me, like massive lies perpetrated by our &#8220;leadership&#8221;.  All the responses on here show what reality is, not the numbnuts writing.</p></div><div

I own firearms because I enjoy shooting and have at times had to travel through some of the highest crime rate cities in the U.S. I  have a cchl which means I have been checked out by the FBI ,state and local law enforcement .

No, I haven&#8217;t traveled much, unless you count having lived in 10 different states clear across the country, and a year in a sailboat in the Bahamas, and several trips to Europe.  It probably doesn&#8217;t count that I lived in Germany for 4 years as a child.  I carry &#8211; for the same reason that I have IRA&#8217;s and fire-extinguishers.

I am well educated, own several high tech companies, am in the top 0.5% income bracket ($750k+ per year), donate to various charities, help folks who hit hard times, prefer to live in peace, am armed to the teeth at home,  and legally carry a concealed Glock .40 caliber handgun pretty much anywhere I travel.  I would love nothing more than to get through my life without having to take another person&#8217;s life &#8211; much less ever have to pull my Glock on a perp.  But if threatened by a perp I will not hesitate to stop the threat in order to preserve my life and/or to prevent damage to my body, or likewise for a family member or loved one.  If prosecuted or sued I will take my chances with the members of the jury.  I do not live as a paranoid old white guy, I am a reasonable person who takes reasonable precautions to hep ensure I will live a long and safe lifetime while protecting myself,  family and loved ones.  I am not one to be trifled with. Screw with me and there will be severe consequences.  We will in a fairly civilized society, but in the midst of folks who mean to do harm for their own illicit purposes.  It is my duty to be prepared to defend against such threats that do exist.</p></div><div

I was born in Miami, went to Med School in Chicago, which was where I happened to be when the American Nazi Party felt a need to march in Skokie, an area where survivors of the Nazi death camps lived. It was then that I knew I stood a chance of being persecuted or attacked in this country, regardless of my then beliefs. I learned how to shoot and bought my first gun, a Beretta 9mm. I have since become a Baptist, but remain an active gun enthusiast and collector. To other Beretta 92 owners, consider sending it to Wilson Combat for optimization.

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48250"><p>I&#8217;m a 42 yr old UC Berkeley grad in psych who went to Tulane Law. I grew up in Chicago (was shot there despite all the gun laws) and have lived in San Fran, Oakand, LA, Nashville, New Orleans, Miami and Tampa. All major cities. I&#8217;ve practiced as a public defender and now I&#8217;m a personal injury attorney. Both fairly liberal jobs. I&#8217;ve traveled to Mexico multiple times, Canada several   times, Greece and Italy. Oh and I collect and read books. A member of 3 book clubs and consume them at a rate of 3 per week on average. I carry either a 1911, BHP or Glock everyday. Usually 2 handguns on me except when in court. I also shoot 3 gun and therefore have several AR&#8217;s. So except for being white I am more or less the opposite of everything in that profile. But let&#8217;s be fair, I&#8217;m biased after being shot in the most gun controlled city in the US: Chicago and having been shot at in San Fran and Oakland. Other bastions of gun control. Plus as a Public Defender I had a unique perspective into what&#8217;s really out there.</p></div><div

I must point out a grammatical error in your article. You mention you have a BA in English Literature so I must point this out since it is imperative to dispel the claim gun owners are illiterate and Caucasian. BTW, I am an American Indian and a citizen of a federally recognized tribe. Be that as it may here is a section of your sentence with the error:<br
/> &#8220;disdain for gun owners that their incapable of having a civil discussion on the topic&#8221; I believe you want to use &#8220;they&#8217;re&#8221; instead of &#8220;their.&#8221;</p></div><div

At the age of 9 I received my first firearm &#8211; Ted Williams .410 shotgun.  Guns were used primarily for food and secondarily for varmints (mostly four-legged).  I have a little education like a B.S. in business, an MBA, an M.Div., and a D.Min.   The last two required at least a year each of Greek and Hebrew languages. Yes, I am now a pastor.  I hunt, shoot, and do believe in personal protection.  Even Jesus permitted side arms (And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, &#8220;It is enough.&#8221; Luke 22:38 KJV).  We live in a country that has been transformed in the wrong direction.  We have a lot of people who suffer from &#8220;entitlement syndrome&#8221; and many lacking common sense.  We also have a lot of greedy people and when it comes to politics I just advise people &#8220;Follow the money!&#8221;  We are falling back into the old feudalism model where a few hold the power and the rest of us serfs are unarmed, working stiffs who pay to support them and their minions.  History is filled with civilizations that left their moral roots and rotted away into some form of dictatorial feudalism though today we give it nicer labels like liberal (with your money), progressive (with their plan to rule you), communism (the state rules), socialism (all people equal &#8211; in poverty).  The end result is to do away with the original vision of the founders of this nation &#8211; small government and personal liberty.</p></div><div

/> I have always owned a gun as long as I can remember. Many in my collection are heir looms handed down. I do have modern weapons and purchase them because I love to shoot. As far as home security I do feel I owe it to my family as the head of my house hold to do whatever I can to make my family as safe as possible. Everyone in my home has had firearms training and can operate all the weapons in my house. So no we are not scared.<br
/> I have been on every continent and more countries that I can name. I am college educated. I watch all the news networks as well as many outside the USA because no one should take anything on the media at face value. Everyone should form there own opinions and use the brain that God has blessed them with.<br
/> Then have an informed and civil conversation.<br
/> I have guns and it is how I was raised. To be self reliant and take nothing for granted. I will always be able to protect those I love, provide for them and know they are able to protect themselves and provide for themselves if needs be.<br
/> Guns are tools and in the right hands very good ones. Like all tools they can be use by anyone to do unspeakable harm. And like always it&#8217;s better to be prepared for the worst. Tomorrow is never guaranteed.<br
/> I believe everyone has the right to defend themselves and to make the decision on how to do it.<br
/> Moreover I feel people need to take personal responsibility for themselves and their actions in all things. Your actions have consequences and each person should be held responsible for how they conduct their own lives. Your lifestyle is you God given right and you must live with your choices. Good or bad.</p></div><div

I know the idiot talked about uneducated  people and I guess that&#8217;s me with only a high school education,I started a State Job While in High School and retired from that job with 30 years at age 47 so I could do what I love,hunt,fish,trap,target shoot and most everything conected to the great outdoors.Although I own many gun&#8217;s none of them are AR&#8217;s,AK&#8217;s,SKS&#8217;s or high caliber semi auto hand guns. When I carry it is a Colt Detective Speacial,for those who don&#8217;t that is a  6 shot revolver! I support the 2nd amendment because of what I live to do and also for those who think the high capacity semi auto rifles  and hand guns are the way to go.Coman sences is what makes a responsible gun owner and all my freinds who just happen to be black are hunting,fishing,trapping, pick up truck driving low level educated people like me who afraid of nothing and responsable with guns as any college educated person.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48308"><p>I&#8217;m 49 retired LEO due to a health issue and former infantry soldier.  My undergrad is in business and I have a Master&#8217;s of Science in criminal justice and am an adjunct professor at two universities.  I hunt, not as much as I&#8217;d like, and shoot occasionally.  Since I retired I was lucky enough to find employment in the oil and gas industry that pays more than law enforcement ever did and am able to purchase firearms to my liking.  Most I have never shot but may at any time.  Point is one can do what they like with their money.  I celebrated my 25th wedding anniversary in Paris (France) Oct 14, spent ten days in Germany and Croatia last year while visiting my son stationed in Germany and toured Italy in 2006.  We always vacation in Florida and have been to Cancun once, not going back, and have spent time in Puerto Rico.  I enjoy travel a little more than I enjoy my firearms or I would have more of them.<br
/> Why do I enjoy firearms?  Maybe because as a kid we played cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers or I rely on myself to protect and support my family.  Difference then was that kids played with toy guns and parents parented their children, unlike today where ass clowns leave their &#8220;real&#8221; guns out for their kids to play with in the parks.<br
/> I like classic cars also but they require too much money for me to even get started with.<br
/> Many people invest in 401k&#8217;s, IRA&#8217;s etc. because they know social security won&#8217;t cover living expenses or might not even exist. Some people have guns because the police are not always available or are minutes away when the situation needs immediate attention.<br
/> It is not an problem or even wrong to be prepared.</p></div><div

Been shooting since 10, ceased hunting after Nam, but continue to shoot and collect guns. I enjoy the challenge of hitting what I aim for, the pleasure of an outdoors day with friends, reloading what I shoot is part of the &#8220;gun&#8221; experience. Now living in Alabama, the new Remington plant is coming on line 7 miles from where I sit. Also have a carry permit, have had for 2 decades, never shot anyone lately.   More concerned about problems in Russia, China and Mid East than in Ferguson.  We in the USA will eventually get it right.   Are technical manuals serious books?  I read them all the time a favorite is &#8220;Linux Internals&#8221;</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48332"><p>I am 53 years old, grew up in small town Ohio raised by loving Democrats but when I turned 18 and voted for the first time I voted for Reagan. I married at 22 and we had children early  and because I couldn&#8217;t find work in my home town I joined the Air Force in 1983 and retired in 2003. I never handled anything other than a BB gun growing up but my job in the AF was Security Forces. Security Forces is a combination of Law Enforcement, Security and infantry, so I was introduced to firearms. I was also trained to handle and properly us them.<br
/> I have been all over this great country from east to west and north to south. I also have lived in multiple European countries, the the Far East and Middle East and have had the opportunity to experience a variety of cultures.  I don&#8217;t watch much news because I feel facts have been replaced by opinions. I like to read history books on military battles or military heroes.<br
/> I purchased my first firearm in the mid 80s and have been a shooting enthusiast since then. Because of my military and law enforcement background I like military style firearms, both modern and historic. I mostly just target shoot with the occasional hunting trip. I always said my firearms were a hobby and not for protection, until the incident in the Colorado theater.<br
/> My wife and I go to the movies often and it is usually to see a good comedy. My wife has health issues that limit her mobility and the theater shooting got me thinking what could we have done in that situation. She can&#8217;t run, I wouldn&#8217;t leave her so that left us with praying to be spared. This is when I decided to get my carry permit. Would having a firearm in that situation have helped, I don&#8217;t know, but I would rather have a chance than no chance.<br
/> I spent 20 years carrying a weapon professionally and was blessed to never having to use it. I hope this to hold true in my civilian carry. I am more than willing to go my entire life never needing my firearm for nothing more than a hobby. The problem is evil is out there and it is not limited to any one race, religion, or group and the sad reality is the police can not always be there. Like someone said in a previous comment it&#8217;s like having a fire extinguisher or a spare tire, you hope you don&#8217;t have to use it but you know it&#8217;s there if needed and you know how to use it.</p></div><div

It is a Middle class group of people that work everyday and enjoy walking their dogs and talking to one another.   I don&#8217;t have my guns for protection, but to shoot targets and practice the skills I learned as a Marine.  Don&#8217;t actually watch much TV, but do like to read a lot, mostly History, Geology, Science Fiction, some interesting books on Time and Astro Physics.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48355"><p>I’m 78, a Professor Emeritus of Chemistry (in Connecticut), Ph.D. , Syracuse University, living in a small rural (for Connecticut) town.  At age 14 in a western New York village, I bought my first gun from Sears &#8211; a Mossberg bolt action 20 gauge.  I’ve been a hunter and recreational shooter all of my life.  I’ve also been an NRA &#8211; certified instructor in five categories for about forty years but am only rarely teaching at this point.  I’ve done a lot of bow hunting in Connecticut and Vermont until recently when I had to go to a crossbow because of a bad shoulder.  I don’t like the X-bow very much so my time in the deer woods has dwindled to almost nothing the last couple of years.  But I still have my well-trained Springer so we go after pheasants once in a while.  It’s all put-and-take hunting for them in CT, though – not like the broad cornfield valleys and hills of Steuben County with native birds.<br
/> I spend my time playing golf in the summer, basketball in the cold months and composing music for orchestra, small ensembles, solo instruments and chorus, and writing opinion pieces about the global warming fraud.  Not many people have heard my music and I’m not really interested in trying to get it played by a real orchestra, but I like it so I play the electronic orchestra version CD in my 2003 Dodge Ram hemi-engine 4&#215;4 pickup.<br
/> I’m a former Republican and have done a few things civically, but I registered Libertarian a few years ago out of frustration with the GOP.  That was around the time that Bush said McCain-Feingold was unconstitutional … and then signed it.</p></div><div

While in a gun shop one evening I had a discussion with an older black fella, he commented, in his neighborhood, he had to keep a handgun at the ready in case someone broke into his apartment while he was home. He claimed this was a common ocurrence. I was surprised at his comment having always took gun rights for granted (young &amp; naive), not seeing that there was a real need for self  protection. Now as an old man in my 60&#8217;s life is so much more dangerous, not in my neighborhood so much,but rather his.<br
/> I&#8217;ll bet the author of  that one sided article, didn&#8217;t have any conversations with any other races about their side of the equation. Stupid, one sided, and not a very good perspective on his part, or was it just plain race baiting. You don&#8217;t have to be well read or well rounded to be a decent gun toting person. God bless, or is that wrong too!</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48392"><p>I am a 68 year old Vietnam vet and have been a gun owner since I was 16. I own guns because I like shooting and when I was younger I was an avid hunter. I do carry a gun for self defense for one reason. I had a lot of bullets wizz by me while I was in Vietnam and I will be damned if I am going to take a bullet from some pimply faced kid who thinks his life is so tough. I will shoot back!!!!!!<br
/> I am not an uneducated redneck. I am a college graduate, enjoy reading and theater and hold a good position at a major company. I understand why many people are against gun ownership but in most cases they are ignorant liberals who know nothing about guns or the shooting sport. I have family who are against gun ownership and I respect their wishes but they also respect my right and my decision to own a gun.<br
/> The article that prompted this response was obviously written by a very ignorant person who has no idea what he is talking about. This is the same type of person who screams about racial profiling and stereotyping and look at what he is doing in his article. I am not scared of black people (my family has many bi racial marriages) I do live within 1 mile of a university, I read  complicated books (I think this guy is still struggling with Dick and Jane). I have lived most of my life in New York City (is that a big enough town for him) and have traveled extensively. The only thing that article proved to me is that he is an idiot.</p></div><div

Have been a world traveler for over 40 yrs &amp; have  live &amp; worked on all continents except Antarctica.  I can communicate in a couple other languages other than my mother tongue of English. My permanent residence is in a city with a population of approximately 1,000,000 people of various religious &amp; ethnic backgrounds. We 3 nationally recognized universities &amp; numerous other smaller &amp; less well known colleges &amp; learning centers.  I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of reading Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;Man Who Would Be King&#8221;,  Hawking&#8217;s &#8220;A Brief History of Time&#8221;  as well as a few other comparable books.  I&#8217;ve also had one of my own works published.</p><p>I live in a quiet middle class neighborhood in community that received national recognition for a long running impossibly low crime rate.  I have no particular fear of break in, burglaries, theft, assaults or strong arm robberies in public, I&#8217;m not  a prepper, not a paramilitary activist, don&#8217;t feel any irresistible compulsion towards concealed carry at every opportunity ( but have no qualms about concealed carry in many situations ).</p><p>My father and all my uncles were either avid hunters, formal combat veterans,  firearms collectors &amp; in the case of one uncle &#8211; a gunsmith.  My grandsons are ex military. My granddaughter&#8217;s husband in in law enforcement.My sister is the former ladies skeet champion of her state.  I participated in shooting competitions in my younger days. Recently have taken up skeet, trap &amp; five stand. Still make regular trips to the pistol &amp; rifle range.  I enjoy reloading &amp; making my own ammo as much as I do shooting.</p><p>Firearms have been a normal part of everyday existence in my family for generations. The same is true for a great many of my friends, co-workers &amp; acquaintance.  Never in my 61 yrs, have I ever seen a weapon discharged in anger, or used for evil, violent or malicious intent.</p><p>I have my suspicions that the so called &#8220;journalist&#8221; Mr Mulford may be the person who avoids reading &#8220;complicated books&#8221;.<br
/> I also suspect that if he did attend university, its highly likely that his education may have far exceeded the capacity of his intelligence.  While the man may have &#8220;good intentions&#8221;  its also my opinion that it appears to have his head stuck up a dark &amp; smelly orifice !<br
/> Just MHO !</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48409"><p>In my house we support the Constitution and Bill of Rights. We all swore an oath to defend this nation from enemies foreign and domestic. There were four of us and we all served. Dad, Army Air Corp WW2, Mom, USMC WW2, still kicking and shooting at 94, Brother, Vietnam Air Force, and me Navy. Heaven forbid anything catastrophic occurs but it will be the same liberal anti gunners that will seek out our help in time of need. They will want us to share our food, medicine, supplies and protect them from unruly mobs intent on violence. It is also the same people who we will protect and help to the best of our ability. Why would we do this is simple. They are Americans and we will defend our way of life and this Republic. Saddening as that fact may be it&#8217;s simply the way we were taught by God loving parents. I&#8217;m also distraught that these same people do not seem to understand what America is all about. They are quick to tell us how educated they are and what circles seems to give them this consensus of superiority. As books are of concern to these self serving intellects I suggest one very old American book to help them understand why we are they way we are. I suggest reading &#8220;Common Sense, The Rights of Man,&#8221; by Thomas Paine. Written to expose tyranny or suppression of individuality it is but one example of why we let people like Mark Morford have the freedom of speech we so cherish. But, if Morford becomes successful in his viewpoint and the Second Amendment gets trashed and all guns are destroyed we then revert back to tyranny. The cycle begins again, we must take up arms to overthrow a corrupt institution looking for personal gain and restore ourselves to the inalienable rights we are destined to have. We must allow the Morford types to spew whatever nonsense they think we should endure because that is their right. The same rights my family has sworn to protect and cherished for so long. I suppose this is when I&#8217;m suppose to brag about my gun collection or my education but that is not necessary. We live in Cocke County Tennessee and yes Mr Morford you are welcome to break bread with us and we will help you when you ask. III%</p></div><div

I shoot because it&#8217;s fun! I love the precision of a well made mechanical design and the challenge of competition. I also carry because it&#8217;s the responsible thing to do in a dangerous and unpredictable world. I read fiction and non fiction on a regular basis. I&#8217;m not much of a TV watcher. I do not hunt but have no quarrel with those who do. Many of my friends hunt. I&#8217;d rather be performing music, recording or shooting one of my pistols. I train regularly and compete in IDPA. Two maladies afflict the human race. One is ignorance. The other is stupidity. Ignorance can be remedied.</p></div><div

May all those who think they can talk our freedoms away f*ck-off and die in severe misery!</p><p>The only thing that ever made this Country worth living in is the non- negotiable rights and freedom gaurenteed every American Citizen under the Constitution of the United States and fought for by all of us Veterans.</p><p>Tell Obama, Holder, Clinton, Pelosi and the rest of their kind to stay out of our way or we will take appropriate action and there are those who may push the envelope and cancel their threats by any means necessary!</p></div><div

If not, then his comments are just vague musings of a person of little facts and not my concern.</p><p>If the real questions are about people being killed, then let&#8217;s talk. Why doesn&#8217;t he get upset at the alcohol related auto deaths in the U.S. every year. Do we outlaw alcohol or vehicles? If there were half as much effort to stop the illegal sale of booze and cars as there is for buying a gun, then he may have a remote chance to have a conversation with me about the subject. Mark Morford is the person my grandfather told me about.  He said, son everyone has an opinion.  Opinions are like butts, everyone has one and most all of them stink.</p><p>I pity Mr. Morford and his true lack of knowledge. I feel sorry that someone so educated, is so ignorant.  Thank God for people who can have intelligent conversations and be open minded on all subjects. America, what a country!</p></div><div

I have a large number of firearms, many I have inherited  from family as far back as my Great Grand Father. I feel I am a custodian of those historical firearms and intend to pass them on to my heirs. I am a combat veteran of Vietnam and a former police detective. I firmly believe in passing on my ability to protect myself and my family with a firearm and affirm the responsibility that should accompany such ownership. I am concerned about the current assault on the 2nd amendment by our current Federal Administration. I am a long way from being a racist. I have children who have married into other races and I am quite comfortable with that. I am a proud Grand Father that fears for my Grand Children&#8217;s future because of the current conduct our poorly lead Federal Government.</p></div><div

Having pushed on for more than 80 years allows me to think that I have some latitude earned by years of adhering to the popular line of liberal thinking dominating American society, but now I have become a racist in these so-called &#8220;Golden years.&#8221;  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are plenty of Colored People that I have enjoyed knowing over the years, and a few who I would classify as friends, but damn-it-all, I don&#8217;t like Black Culture!  I don&#8217;t like &#8220;Shucking n jiving&#8221; I don&#8217;t like &#8220;Being so coo-I-be-icy!&#8221;  I don&#8217;t like seeing the crotch of the pants worn at the knee level, but hey, there are White Folks things I don&#8217;t like such as rings in the nose, lips, ears and tongue.  I still work, and often have occasion to leave the plant at nighttime and being an old man with a number of health considerations realize I am a sitting target for some young buck to seek my wallet only because I am no threat to a potential mugger.  Call me a coward, but I drop that little 32 caliber colt automatic or sometimes 38 caliber revolver in a pocket hoping to never have call to use it.  My years at Ohio State University or my degree in Mechanical engineering or having read any number of so-called great books are not going to protect me and maybe that gun in my pocket won&#8217;t either but it at least allows me to walk among the public knowing that I stand at least some chance of surviving being an easy pick, in the eyes of some young thugs, whether white or black, but most likely black.</p></div><div

I love guns because they are magnificent works of engineering arts. Plus, ballistics make physics more fun. I know that our 2A right is something not given to us by any entity; it is something all citizens of the USA have from the moment they become a citizen until they are dead, in jail, or have defected. It is there to protect that part in the Constitution that says, &#8220;right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; Gun control has never been about safety, it about control. If it was, it would be call gun safety, which is something that already exist and it taken very serious by most gun owners. I see regulation of guns no differently than the MCA in the UK and how it assaults one right to free speech and can be used as an impromptu censorship measure.</p></div><div

Then it dawned on me, it really doesn&#8217;t matter what his opinion is or what he writes about. After all he is in the business of making his income via what he writes about. I&#8217;m not a follower of Mr Morford but my guess is he plays of the negitive aspects of life and socity, propabily because that&#8217;s as far as his talents can reach and he feels he can make the most dollars from the uneducated sector of socity. In reality, Monford is a narrow minded, low talented penman that could care less about how his writings can encourage violence, carnage, racism and other negitive circumstances in America. My bet is; most intelligent folks, whether they carry a gun or Bible don&#8217;t pay much attention to Monfords rants and rages. Fact of the matter is: Monford will probably rub the wrong way on someone some day and that person will give Morford what he really deserves for the wrong he has/is impacting on all whom reads his trach writings. Oh,,,, by the way, Mr Mark Monford, if you would ever like to try some hunting here in Georgia, if guns are too scary for your mintality, we also hunt more with bows and arrows down here in Georgia. I would personally welcome you to join me on a good old GA wild bore, hog hunting venture. It would be lots of fun for both, the hogs and ME. you-all come see, ya hear!<br

My father made his living as a professional custom gunsmith/stockmaker so I grew up around guns.  My wife and I took an early retirement, sold our home, and moved aboard our 42&#8242; sailing ketch.  We lived aboard while cruising the East coast, Bahamas and the Caribbean for a dozen years. Even though we tried to avoid the most troublesome areas on the Caribbean,  I always carried a shotgun and handgun aboard to fend off would be pirates and thieves.  While I have nothing against them, I don&#8217;t own any so-called &#8220;black guns&#8221; as I much prefer the look, feel, and craftsmanship of fine wood.  I&#8217;ve been shooting skeet competitively since my early 20&#8217;s and have more championships than I can recall, including a open World title.  I am a proud gun owner.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48557"><p>I am a 64 yr old white guy, retired after 30 yrs as a California peace officer.  I live in N. Idaho now, having escaped all of the BS CA has become.  I have been shooting since I was about 10 yrs old.  I have killed lots of deer, and other game as well, all of which we consumed.  I am a veteran of the USAF 1969-1972, graduated from college with a degree in admin of justice.  I am a husband, a dad, a grandpa.  I am unafraid and willing to defend my home and my family against any that would harm us or take from us, because that is how I was raised.  I will also stand for the weak and the innocent…in short I am a sheepdog.  The only race issues I ever had to deal with was when others hated me because I am white.<br
/> I am concerned with what I see happening right now in our country…and how our &#8220;leaders&#8221; perceive it, and respond to it.  I am concerned that there is a lot more people than ever before who hate their country, and those who enforce our laws.   A lot of them hate their parents, and what they call &#8220;the system&#8221;.  I grew up when drugs started coming onto the scene, when the younger generation was dropping out, when politicians began to lie to the public with regularity, when police were called &#8220;pigs&#8221; and the flag was lit on fire.  College campuses became intolerant of conservatism and today are bastions of liberal thought.  My people didn&#8217;t buy into any of that, so neither did I.  And most of Americans didn&#8217;t either, thank God.  And speaking of God, it seems to me that He has been pushed out to the back burner by many in the past 50 years, including those who are in charge of our administration as a country.  We seemed to be a whole lot more squared away, flaws and all, when we were a God-fearing people who put Him first in our lives.<br
/> Gun ownership is on the rise because deep down, Americans know that what the left preaches is pure, unadulterated crap, and they don&#8217;t want to get caught with their pants down when their ownership rights become suppressed by politicians…America is a land of gun owners, shooters, and defenders…and we always will be.  We are the only country in the world where gun ownership is considered a right, not a privilege.  If you study world history, you will see that the people of those countries who have suffered the most are those that were unarmed by their leaders.<br
/> Besides hunting and recreation, having and using a gun falls into the same category as having a fire extinguisher.  It is my right to have one and to shoot one, and people who don&#8217;t like that can go to hell.</p></div><div

For the next person who thinks it his right to stalk me, steal my mail so he can talk to me, cut the phone lines so i can&#8217;t call for help , throw off the power breaker to my light, making friends with guard dog so he can put her up in her pen, slashing the tires on my car so I can&#8217;t leave, then break into my house thinking I&#8217;m going to to still laying in bed instead of running out the other door to my aunt and uncles house across the street</p></div><div

I currently live in a city in Texas with a population of more than 3 million but grew up in Riverside, CA.  I have been to mexico many times since my youth, I have also been to the Middle East, Africa, several European Countries, Canada and Russia.  I have an extensive background in martial arts and I own my firearms because you never know when you will need one.  I also enjoy shooting firearms at the local shooting ranges.  Of course similarly to my martial arts where I train every day to have the abilities to kill someone, I live my life with the hopes and the intent to never have the obligation to use my martial abilities nor my firearms on another human being however,I will always be prepared to.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-48587"><p>I am a 47 year old semi retired Electronics Engineer that now spends most of his time wiring houses.  I have traveled in Canada, Mexico, Finland, and the currently non existent, but may return if Putin gets his way Soviet Union. My first unaccompanied trip out of the U.S. was at the age of 7 .  I have also lived in Sweden.  I raised on science and mathematics only at the age of 30 did I develop a taste for history and spirituality. I speak three languages and have been blessed to have had conversations over food and drink with two U.S. Presidents, numerous U.S. senators, and representatives, foreign commissioners, ambassadors, and even one King.</p><p>I never served in the military, though learned to first handle a firearm in the Reserve Officer Training Core.  Supplemental to that I took training in survival, reconnaissance, demolition, and combat medicine. This was because I was raised in the cold war.  When you were raised in the cold war the way I was, you were sure that some day someone was going to do something really stupid.  Having a firearm was a patriotic duty because the freedoms we enjoyed were precious and hard to come by in the world.  Those freedoms are even harder to come by now.  We were looking out for the enemy that was going to come and take those freedoms away.  We should have been looking in.</p><p>The government in the U.S. has more power over the day to day lives of it&#8217;s “citizens” now than at any time ever in our history. Some of the common phrases of my youth sound foreign now&#8230; , “Don&#8217;t make a federal case out of it!” and “It&#8217;s a free country!” run directly in the face of what most “citizens” are told is the nature of our government.  I have learned from my travels, personal experiences, and history, that the bigger a government gets, the less able it is to act effectively when needed.  Most of the leaders I have talked with will admit that the people who would look to government for protection in an emergency should not.  It will sometimes lack the will or ability to help, but will most often lack the speed needed.</p><p>I have used my first aid kits and limited medical training in emergencies to help save two lives of people I did not know before paramedics could arrive.  I have used my survival training to help a mother and child stuck in the wilderness survive several nights of sub freezing weather before rescuers could get to them. And I have drawn my firearm one time and stopped a would be robber from stabbing a store clerk who he did not realize was already pointing a shotgun at his hart while police were still on the way.</p><p>I keep my water filtration equipment, generator, cooking fuel, pantry, first aid kits, and my firearms to protect and serve my family, my self, and my neighbors not because shit might happen, but because it does happen.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-49181"><p>I am..let me see..57 years of age, did graduate from high school. Spent 30 months in Germany, toured a lot of Europe when we had the time and weren&#8217;t out playing Army,  Have been to sent to a few other places that I can&#8217;t talk of still, in 1980 after Castro decided that he was going to be magnanimous and allow so many of his country&#8217;s men, women and children to come to the US, many of whom were released from his prisons.  The U.S. Army was tasked with containing and documenting all these folks, just to make sure they didn&#8217;t have any diseases that we didn&#8217;t know about.  Any one out there get deployed to Fort Chaffee Ark in the early 80s part of the Cuban Resettlement Operation?</p><p>Guns?  Yep had one from the time I was about 10 years old growing up in the mountains of Northwest Pennsylvania. Hunted throughout my teen years, until I left to play Army for real.  As a civilian law enforcement officer I spent ten years as a police officer and 14 years working as a corrections officer for the Florida Dept. of Corrections.  Was hurt in a riot in 1990, worked ten years hurt and was retired in 2001 with a neurological disease that has over the years exacerbated injuries received while in the Army. In 2009 the VA decided I was bade enough to be granted disability at 100%.  In September of 2014 I was declared messed up enough that I now need one of those electric scooter you see so many of us vets on.  Why did I tell you all this, what bearing does it have on gun ownership you ask?  Simple&#8230;I am well and truly fucked up and to damn old to be fighting someone half or a third my age.  I carry..daily..I don&#8217;t want to be a victim, nor will I allow myself, my wife of 33 years or our son who has Down Syndrome to be victims..that&#8217;s why.</p><p>As for education, besides high school, I did take some college and if I so decided could take the core subjects and then have enough credits to earn a BS or BA degree..in something.  Not being allowed to work under the conditions of my medical retirement from the good folks at the Division of Retirement (work comp section) I decided early after I was retired to not seek my degree for it would not do me any good.  To say I had it..or I earned it wouldn&#8217;t do, if I had it, I would want to put it to use.  That said, my wife is 9 credits from her BA in education, byt has decided that the state of Florida does not pay its teacher well for what they have to do, especially in Special Ed. she is perfectly happy as a teacher assistant and has enough years to be allowed to do pretty much as she likes at the school where she works.  Between us, we earn $85-$90K a year, enough to live and get by on</p><p>I am a licensed amateur radio operator..a ham radio operator, yes the hobby is alive and well and thriving. My wife is a Red Cross volunteer and is a certified shelter manager should a disaster of some sort befall us and shelters are opened, my wife would go to one shelter and be the overall manager.  I on the other hand would go to another location where my ham radio hobby would then morph into what is called the amateur radio service, for we do serve in pretty much any disaster providing communication when and where we can.<br
/> I may not be as educated as some, certainly more than others, consider myself well rounded, have a diverse interest in various books and music.  Try to attend church regularly, but haven&#8217;t recently due to my neurological diseases&#8230;I now have two diseases both of which cause intense, severe, and any other adjective you would like to put in front of &#8216;pain&#8217;. I do in no way shape or form consider myself prejudice&#8230;we have an adopted daughter who is originally from Haiti, and is a legal US citizen.  Our biological daughter is also a disabled veteran she broke or rather blew out her T12 vertebrae  training to go to Iraq as..an MP..like father like daughter.  All except our son are trained and try when time and body condition allow go to the range and keep our skills at least up to most any challenge, not gonna be sniping an enemy at 1000 meters with my AR..we&#8217;ll leave it at that.<br
/> Yes, I am a proud gun owner, who thinks that way too many of our rights and grredoms have been taken&#8230;ripped from our grasp by the current administration.  Does that mean I&#8217;m gonna go and talk trash and shoot at the White House or any of our legislators&#8230;.not a chance.  That is for those who are paranoid and think our govt is out to get us.  Too late, they already have.</p></div><div

My brother is a career law enforcement officer, my sister-in-law teaches Criminal Justice at an area college and I worked in law enforcement for a short period of time 30 years ago.  I am a self-employed small business owner who pays over $200,000 in annual federal income taxes.</p></div><div

Have two masters, one in Physics and one in Mechanical Engineering. I make a medium 6 figure income, have been in the engineering field for nearly 25 years. I own my own design company. I&#8217;m a naturalized citizen. My parents came to this country in 1971 and were naturalized 5 years later. I&#8217;ve traveled the world for business and pleasure. I&#8217;m married and have an adult child. My wife, who was a leftist, is no longer and is a conservative and now a proud gun owner herself. Still working on my kid. 😀 I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m quite well read, however, I still drive back to my favorites of sci-fi and fantasy.</p><p>I own my own built AR15, AR10, and have an SA XMD .45 ACP and I&#8217;ve lived in California all of my life. I love football, soccer, Australian Rules Football (watch, it&#8217;s awesome). I don&#8217;t hunt because I don&#8217;t have the heart for it, but I do target shoot on a weekly basis. I&#8217;ve taken tactical training as well.</p><p>I&#8217;ve lived in the Bay Area for quite some time in the past and I can tell you that there are more Mark Morford&#8217;s in that area than just him. This particular type of beclowned overly-smug hipster delta-bravo is an insulated little prig, that knows almost nothing outside of his bemused sense of entitlement. I know the type quite well. Calling them an ass-clown only insults ass-clowns. They will never understand, they will never get it. Mr. Morford probably has never seen a gun, held a gun, or fired a gun and if he has and still has this attitude, well, then sometimes there really is no hope for certain people like him.</p></div><div

Europe 50-54 (US zone of Occupation), Far East 72-73 (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippine&#8217;s, RVN, Thailand) hit every state  but Alaska, have hit Mexico and Canada several times each, just quick drives.  Vet benefits paid for add&#8217;l school, Business and Accounting, 76-79, CPA Cert (CA and FL).  I am retired from the Fed Gov&#8217;t as Accountant/Auditor and IT(90-94 FDIC Orlando, 94-97 FDIC Chicago, 97-12 PBGC and HUD in DC) retiring from HUD(most disgusting waste of money in the Exec Branch).  I have read for my entire life, mostly History, but a great deal of other subjects as well, (I prefer Sci Fi, Historical fiction and thrillers for relaxation).   I started shooting Pellet rifle at 6, 22 RF at about 9 and CF at 17.  I like to shoot and reload, don&#8217;t hunt much, have the land but no one will eat game but me, so not worth it.  I own handguns, rifles and shotguns, and enjoy shooting them all when I can.  Blackpowder cartridge rifles, but all sorts of bolts, pumps, levers, and semi-auto&#8217;s as well.  I am not stupid or paranoid (IQ in mid-150 range) but I am a realist, and it takes the Police too many minutes to get here, and I would rather not risk that without a backup plan, or three.  I carry (ditto) as well and have nothing but respect for Law Enforcement as a whole, but to restate the obvious, if someone wants to do something vile and unspeakable to you or yours, you had better be prepared to handle it yourself, and be prepared to deal with the aftermath.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-50121"><p>I&#8217;m probably the furthest from the stereotypical gun-lovin&#8217; yahoos that most liberals use to stereotype and vilify everyone who upholds the 2A and responsible gun use and ownership. I have an MA in int. bus. I love children and animals because of their honesty and innocence. Most adults could learn a lot from them. I worked with children for a few years, and then I was a professor for many years, lived abroad and traveled abroad in Pacific Rim Asian countries, and worked in one of them for many years. Guns are rare and viewed as something to be feared in those countries. Police in some of those countries only carry air guns. Of course, different demographics and philosophies but some people like the mafia do have guns but they&#8217;re rarely used. A year before returning to my country of origin, I began doing research about crime and self-defense/protection.  I did some research but not the extent like I have been doing recently, reading peer reviewed studies and research about the effects on crime rates involving CCW permits, crimes involving hand guns, etc. I&#8217;m unassuming and peaceful but I understand the implications of hand guns being the greater equalizer in a situation where you have to defend yourself and/or the lives of others, especially loved ones. My primary concern and interest in guns and CCW permits is for the safety of my parents who are getting older. There have been situations where they all of us could have been potential targets of a violent robbery (getting gas at night while sometimes traveling long distances between two cities). I also realized that &#8220;In any case, the claim that as a moral or practical matter a crime victim should rely on the government for protection can be raised only if the government has an obligation to protect the victim. And quite clearly under American law, the government has no such obligation&#8221; (Tennessee Law Review 62:3 [Spring, 1995] 679-757).  So much for 911 because as a CCW and former and now retired Sheriff told our class, when seconds count police are minutes away. I choose to be proactive and not live in regret. If I never use my hand gun at least I will have peace of mind because as aptly stated:</p><p>&#8220;In addition to the lives that could be saved by licensed, trained citizens carrying guns, there is a second, important benefit: peace of mind. Many people choose to buy automobiles with passenger-side air bags or other safety features; many people also choose to use the seat belts in a car. It is unlikely, of course, that on any given automobile trip, there will an accident in which the safety belt, or other safety device, in needed; similarly, it is unlikely that a person who goes out in public will be attacked by a criminal on any given day. But even on days when drivers are not struck by other cars, the safety devices confer a genuine benefit, because the drivers feel safer. Likewise,</p><p>If people feel safer because they own a gun and in turn lead happier lives because they feel safer and more secure, then their guns make a direct and nontrivial contribution to their overall quality of life. [119]</p><p>If women feel safer walking at night because they can carry a firearm, then the firearm makes a tangible contribution to a better society, whether or not a statistically significant drop in the crime rate results.</p><p>Of course the increased peace of mind that results from people knowing they will be able to protect themselves would not be beneficial if there was more criminal violence as a result. But as the data presented above indicate, all of the data suggest that allowing licensed, trained citizens to carry firearms for protection will not cause more gun crime&#8221; (Tennessee Law Review 62:3 [Spring, 1995] 679-757).</p></div><div
