property="og:description" content="I don’t know how many times I have seen on an internet gun classified or auction, “No Sales to California!” (It’s usually on the item I really want too…) Sometimes people like to be cute, and call it “Kalifornia” instead. Most sellers who do this make reference that due to laws they don’t agree with, they refuse to sell to buyers in the Golden State, and seat of liberal silliness. Sometimes they just feel like there is too much nonsense to deal with and it isn’t worth their time, and sometimes they just won’t do it on principle." /><meta

style="padding-bottom:15px" align="left"><p> By Brian Jensen</p><p></p><p>I don’t know how many times I have seen on an internet gun classified or auction,  “No Sales to California!”   (It’s usually on the item I really want too…)  Sometimes people like to be cute, and call it “Kalifornia” instead.  Most sellers who do this make reference that due to laws they don’t agree with, they refuse to sell to buyers in the Golden State, and seat of liberal silliness.  Sometimes they just feel like there is too much nonsense to deal with and it isn&#8217;t worth their time, and sometimes they just won&#8217;t do it on principle.</p><p> While I respect their convictions, I see their reaction as flawed. For one, there is money to be made on guns in California, for someone who is willing to learn a few simple things.  And as for politics, the main point of their position is the belief that as a result of their refusal to ship us Kalifornians, the would-be gun owners here will rise up, and kick out our village of idiots in Sacramento.</p><p> Unfortunately, this state is so deeply seated in liberal ideology, and conservatives are so heavily outnumbered, this will never be a realistic outcome.  There just aren’t enough of us.</p><p> The end result then becomes that gun sellers in the “free states” for lack of a better word, abandon all the gun owners and potential owners in our state who are already victimized enough by their own government.  If you want to do something to truly help the 2nd Amendment in California, send in more guns!  One more gun means potentially one more gun owner and one more voter, and that&#8217;s a good thing, right?</p><p> Let’s say you’re one of those sellers who is willing to sell to buyers in California.  What do you need to know?</p><h2>What Can People Own…The Certified Gun List…</h2><p> First off, not just any gun can be shipped to California.  Hi-capacity long guns, so called and misnamed &#8220;assault weapons&#8221; are a whole article in themselves.  But we’ll try to touch on that later…  As for handguns, any pistol or revolver must be certified by the state as “safe”.  These weapons are listed on a roster of certified handguns.  Per the California DOJ:</p><p><em><br
/> Effective January 1, 2001, no handgun may be manufactured within California, imported into California for sale, lent, given, kept for sale, or offered/exposed for sale unless that handgun model has passed firing, safety, and drop tests and is certified for sale in California by the Department of Justice. Private party transfers, curio/relic handguns, certain single-action revolvers, and pawn/consignment returns are exempt from this requirement. </em></p><p> These guns are submitted by the manufacturer to the state’s designated labs for testing where they are dropped, banged, and beat up to see if they are likely to go “bang” when dropped.  This is also to determine to the politicians’ particular criteria as “safe”.  The manufacturer then pays the state on a yearly basis to keep that particular model on the list.  In addition, any new gun introduced these days must have a chamber-loaded indicator and magazine disconnect safety.  Older guns are exempt as long as they stay on the roster.</p><p> If you’re looking for the roster, it’s listed on the CA DOJ website.</p><p> Fortunately, only handguns coming into California need to be on this roster so rifles (as long as they are not assault weapons) are easily shipped in our fair state.  Handguns not on the roster can be shipped here as well, as long as it is going to a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO), who is exempt.</p><p> There is also a new way around the roster evolving, called the “Single Shot Exemption” where the gun is made to fire as a single shot pistol, and can therefore be imported.  The owner, once in possession of the firearm, can then convert it back to it’s normal configuration (with the exception of such things as hi capacity magazines…etc.).  This is exemption is still a new idea for California, but the CalGuns group is one of the more informative websites that helps spell this, as well as many other legal matters out.</p><p> One other note, California bans the sale of magazines with a capacity over 10 rounds to the general public.  Even if you are shipping the firearm to a LEO, you’d better check with your receiving FFL to make sure they can accept the magazines, as some can’t.</p><h2>The California CFLC Program</h2><p> Next, any FFL shipping a weapon to a California must be on a list within the CA DOJ database, called the California Firearms License Check (CFLC) System.  The purpose of this is to verify that whoever the shipper is sending the firearm to inside California, is a legitimate FFL that is legally able to receive the firearm.  (Basically, it protects the shipper by preventing shipping to someone posing as an FFL, or who isn’t able to receive the firearm in question.)</p><p> This is actually a relatively easy and free process.  (How many times do you hear “free” along with government program…)  Just contact the state’s DOJ, and they will walk you through how to go through the system.</p><p> When you have a firearm to ship, whether it be a long gun or handgun, just contact the CFLC automated system with the weapon and FFL info.  Then, the automated system will generate a letter of authorization with a specific authorization number to ship the weapon.  Save this letter, as it is your protection that verifies the receiver is legit.  Put a copy of the letter with the gun when you ship it as well.</p><h2>Only to an FFL</h2><p> It is of course a US Federal law that guns crossing state lines have to be shipped to an FFL dealer.  That dealer will do the background check and state paperwork to legally transfer the gun.  California, believe it or not, has a goodly number of FFL’s to service the public.  They are scattered across the state, from venues such as a guy’s garage to large stores, so don’t let their location fool you.  Just use the CFLC and BATFE systems to verify them if you have any doubts.</p><h2>Assault Weapons in Cali…</h2><p> OK, so you might figure that assault weapons are pretty much dead here.  On the contrary!  AR-15 style firearms, and now even AK-style rifles are enjoying a new heyday in California.  This is because of the ingenuity of a few, who saw the raging demand here for such rifles, and found a way to make them work under the law.  You see, any of these weapons are legal, as long two items are met.  First, the gun cannot be listed by name as banned (see below for more information).  Second, the weapon must have a “fixed” 10-round magazine.  This has been determined the magazine can only be removed by means of a “tool”.</p><p>A replacement for the magazine release called a “bullet button,” makes this possible.  The solid metal piece that inserts into the hole of the magazine release makes it so you must insert something long and narrow, like a bullet or punch, into the hole and thus activate the magazine release.  These, and other similar items to make the magazine “permanent” have revolutionized weapons sales in CA.  Guns stores are dedicating large portions of their inventory to the heinous “black rifle”, and they are raking in money hand over fist.</p><p> The source of the situation is from California’s assault weapon bans.  Assault weapons were initially banned by specific name, then by similar series such as AK/AR type rifles, but finally, the legislature banned the guns by feature.  Any semiautomatic centerfire weapon with a detachable magazine, which also has a: pistol grip, thumbhole stock, folding stock, grenade/flare launcher, flash suppressor, or a forward pistol grip was banned.  That’s why any standard AR / AK is illegal, but most semi-auto rifles like the Ruger Mini-14 is perfectly legal.  Some guns, such as any .50 BMG weapon, regardless of configuration, are still Assault weapons, whether single shot, bolt action, or semi-auto.</p><p> As an example, the California Penal Code regarding assault weapons that are rifles:</p><p> California Penal Code Section 30515. <br
/> (a) Notwithstanding Section 30510, &#8220;assault weapon&#8221; also means any of the following:<br
/> (1) A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any one of the following:<br
/> (A) A pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.<br
/> (B) A thumbhole stock.<br
/> (C) A folding or telescoping stock.<br
/> (D) A grenade launcher or flare launcher.<br
/> (E) A flash suppressor.<br
/> (F) A forward pistol grip.<br
/> (2) A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.<br
/> (3) A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches.</p><p> One maker of excellent quality AR components, JD Machine Tech, is located here in San Diego.  Their uppers and lowers are machined here in a nondescript warehouse near downtown and they are considered to be some of the industry’s best, being used by many big names.</p><p> So, if you are indeed sending an assault weapon to our fine state, it may very well be on the up and up.  Some guns are even touted by the manufacturer as being “CA Compliant”.  This usually means it has an apparatus such as the aforementioned “bullet button” or has had one of its “undesirable” attributes removed.  These are legal in California for anyone who can otherwise own a gun.  If, however, the gun is a standard AR, AK, or other s rifle, it can only be shipped to a CA Assault Weapons Dealer, and can only go to a LEO, or other person specified by statute.</p><h2>If all Else Fails, Call the California DOJ</h2><p> I have on numerous occasions had to call the California DOJ for firearms related questions.  I have never been disappointed.  Their staff has been courteous, helpful, and professional, I’ll even go so far as to say downright friendly.  I just try to remember that they are merely the people tasked with deciphering and enforcing the myriad of Firearms laws passed by the people in Sacramento.</p><p> If you are unsure about a potential sale, or have questions about the CFLC program, just call them.  They can steer you in the right direction.  This is especially important in the continually evolving world of firearms.  Their goal is to keep things legal, not to trap other sellers into some legal loophole.</p><h2>Don’t Abandon California</h2><p>OK, so we don’t have to agree that what our legislature does is exactly helpful.  However, our state is not one flush with conservative thinking gun enthusiasts, so changing the laws is slow, painful, and will likely be at the point of the spear (rhetorically speaking) from court decisions in light of Heller and McDonald.</p><p> I won’t pretend to understand all the California firearms laws as they are many.  However, by merely doing your due diligence with the CA DOJ, they can steer you in the right direction, and make shipping a firearm here easier, and without legal peril.  There are other resources such as the CalGuns network, or FFL’s here who have learned the right way to do things.  Open up to California’s firearms market, we have buyers waiting.</p><p>Sources:<br

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6564"><p>Great article. It just irks me when dealers just empathically without just cause &#8220;will not ship to California&#8221;. Well it&#8217;s their loss (money). I know this may seem incredulous but I am a liberal and a gun &#8220;nut&#8221;. Mostly C&amp;R, military battle rifles, little SS .22&#8217;s, older hand guns and etc. I love guns. Not only am I a member of the NRA but also the ACLU. So I liked your article and yes, we do put up with some nonsense here in CA but some things actually make sense such as the 10 day (cooling off period). To me it&#8217;s a pain but if it really did save one life then it&#8217;s worth it, and I can live with that.</p><p>Thank you for an informative article, I just hope some paid attention.</p></div><div

With the instant background check, why should a law abiding person wait to exercise a Constitutional right&#8230; Well they are making us wait to vote in the primary here in Texas. Lawsuits delayed the primary to the point where, once again, Texans will have no voice in who the Republican nominee is. The legislature moved the primary up to Super Tuesday to remedy what happened in 2008. But the federal courts put the fix to that fix.</p></div><div

It bothers me also to think that fellow gun lovers and dealers are taking out their frustrations with the laws and regulations behind gun sales in California. Can&#8217;t say i blame them though. As much as i respect and obey the law, growing up in compton Ca, i always get nervous when i see a cop. Even when he&#8217;s &#8220;just doing his job&#8221;. Now i can only imagine my level of fear and anxiety if i were in the weapons business :/ no one wants to go to jail. It always seems like uncle same leaves just enough room for them to charge you if they really want to, or slap you on the wrist and pretend they&#8217;re giving you a second chance.</p></div><div

/> I agree with this statement but this is a two edge sword. We may have the second amendment but it seems to be bastardised by liberal politicians to be a states right. When ever you hear a politician claim they are conservative but did something progressive (liberal) while they wrer in office they always say they believe it is a states right. This is the Achilles heel interpretation by liberals when it comes to the second amendment.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6571"><p>An OK summary, but let me offer a couple of comments:</p><p>It&#8217;s a single-action exemption for non-listed revolvers, not a single-shot exemption. The argument is that if you take the double-action sear out of a revolver, have both shipped to CA, DROS the revolver as a SA gun and then later put the sear back in, you are theoretically compliant.I would not use of his workaround, which feels sketchy and fragile to me, but others are fine with it. If I wanted a particular unlisted DA revolver I would just try to find one in-state and do a private party transfer.</p><p>CA FFLs are permitted to receive directly from out-of-state individuals who do not have an FFL. Private party shippers do NOT have to go through the CFLC process. Only FFLs (both in-state and out-of-state) must comply with the CFLC process when shipping a gun. This is convenient when it comes to C&amp;R handguns, as it is no harder to ship a C&amp;R into California than it is to get it into any gun-friendly state. The wrinkle here is that C&amp;R license holders, who can receive qualifying handguns directly in most other states, cannot do so in CA. Any handgun must be received and transferred by an 01 licensee in CA. (C&amp;R licensees who reside in CA can buy a C&amp;R handgun out of state, bring it in and self-register on the proper DOJ form.) C&amp;R holders can receive qualifying long guns directly at their in-state address, at least for most of the next two years. Looks like after January 2014 state FFLs will be involved in the long-gun transfers as well.</p></div><div

/> 2)  The current criminal has all of Americas Union votes<br
/> 3)  The current criminal has the votes of every major city in America that borders a major ocean ( Liberals)<br
/> 4)  The current criminal has the votes of the young people educated in our colleges  ( Liberal Colleges )<br
/> 5)  The current criminal has  ( boy this one&#8217;s tough )  all of the black and Latino votes and up and coming illegals that you might say can&#8217;t vote &#8230;&#8230;..  yea right.<br
/> 6)  The current criminal has the press, Media, and the Hollywankers who stupid people listen to, like Opra, Susan Saranwrap, Sean the dickhead Penn, Hanoi Jane, Rosie Ofatdonnell, Ellen Degenerate, The word game guy on the plane and most every Gay and Lesbian in America.<br
/> 7) What do the conservatives have?   Look at your choices,  Not a pretty picture.  David, get ready for the bareknuckle brawl cause it&#8217;s a comin&#8217;  Kiss your rights and your future both financially and healthcare wise goodbuy plus your gun rights. Wait til the 1% bank tax comes in.  Why did this happen ????   Because we allowed it to happen !!!!!!!!!!</p></div><div

/> Rich don&#8217;t go off half cocked, I&#8217;m Latino and was born and bred in Calif. U.S.A. as were my parents and grand parents.  I belong to the NRA and have for quite a few years and I sincerely believe in the second admendment.  I to believe that illegals should not be allowed here, but think why are they here? For jobs! So dry up employment and they would not come here. So blame the damned politicians the don&#8217;t enact laws to fine the employers that hire them and I mean really BIG FINES.  I am sure not voting for any politician that is against the 2nd admendment. There are many latinos that feel this way. I have been hearing this B.S. from the politicians about illegal immigration since I was a kid and that was quite a while ago. So don&#8217;t put all Latinos in the same barrel. I am a gun collector and have to put up with the gun laws of this state that are so stupid that it&#8217;s laughable, for instances I can buy  a colt python that is stainless steel and has a 6 inch barrel but I can&#8217;t buy any other colt python if the barrel is of a different size or is blued how about that for stupidenty! So amigo I feel as you do.</p></div><div

If the federal government would stick to it&#8217;s actual authority and follow the second amendment we wouldn&#8217;t have ANY of the current gun laws on the books except for those preventing (good luck with that) felons or those suffering from mental deficiencies from owning guns.  And since the second amendment is absolute, the states would have to follow it too.  We need to elect people who actually follow their oath&#8217;s of office and who understand what liberty and freedom are really about.  We need to teach everyone the joys of being free and responsible for yourself, because a lot of people don&#8217;t seem to understand it these days.  Especially in the education field.  Only then can we get rid of stupid things like the &#8220;bullet button&#8221;.  You can all help with this endeavor and your help would be greatly appreciated.</p></div><div

The restrictions on a simple gun are incredible. The manufacturers have to make different parts and mags. As far as money to be made. Most things are just way more important than a dollar. What is to be outlawed next? Sneezing, sex, breathing, where does it end.</p></div><div

We&#8217;re fighting for our second amendment rights.  We&#8217;re not sitting back and whining about being victims, we&#8217;re doing something about it.  We fight in the public eye, we fight in the courts, we fight with our votes.  We research, we donate, we write letters, we motivate.</p><p>People spreading FUD and outright wrong info is the antithesis of our fight.  We&#8217;re solidly grounded in right and wrong, facts and evidence.  Don&#8217;t make it worse.</p><p>For those of you in other states that are enjoying you&#8217;re rights, enjoy the hell out of them, we&#8217;re trying our damnedest to stand next to you.

/> &#8220;California Penal Code Section 30515&#8243;<br
/> &#8220;any FFL shipping a weapon to a California must be on a list within the CA DOJ database&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;As for handguns, any pistol or revolver must be certified by the state as “safe”. These weapons are listed on a roster of certified handguns. Per the California DOJ:&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;If, however, the gun is a standard AR, AK, or other s rifle, it can only be shipped to a CA Assault Weapons Dealer, and can only go to a LEO, or other person specified by statute.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;Just contact the state’s DOJ, and they will walk you through how to go through the system. &#8221;  REALLY???  You have to spend time calling politicians to make sure your legal to sell?</p></div><div

They are, in fact, doing exactly what the anti-gun politicians want: making it harder for Californians to buy guns.  Personally, I won&#8217;t do any business with anyone who has this policy, not even for things like cleaning kits and rifle slings, and not even if the laws change and you change your mind down the road.  If you have such a policy on your ads, don&#8217;t bother bidding on a gun I&#8217;ve put up, either&#8211;I won&#8217;t sell to you, just like you won&#8217;t sell to me.  I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way, either&#8211;there&#8217;s a growing number of people on the calguns forums who say the same thing.</p></div><div

It sounds more like Nazi Germany than the United States of America. You have to be a lawyer to understand all the ins and outs of CA laws. It&#8217;s not worth all the hassle to sell a gun there when there are about 46  other States remaining in America where free men still live. We need to start at the top by voting Obama out of office and continuing on downward from there to purge the liberals from our political system.

/> You may call yourself a &#8220;political history buff&#8221;, but denying that liberals are to blame directly and completely for the violation of Constitutional law here is simply incorrect.  I have lived here for 50 years and can tell you without any equivocation that liberals are indeed fully, completely and most sincerely at fault!  A governor does not make law, the legislators do.  Even Reagan was saddled with a democrap legislature.  No where &#8220;along the way&#8221; did republicans ever have such an opportunity, and even [if] they had, the next group would have just changed the clock hands to suit themselves.</p></div><div

The Governor does not have as much power relative to the legislature as the US President has with Congress.

The NRA has its own version of the &#8220;Divide and Conquer&#8221;  policy among gun owners which is similar to the way politicians divide gun owners by stating that it is Ok to have a bolt action hunting rifle, pump shotgun, etc., but not a military style look-a-like rifle that fires the same caliber bullet.</p><p>The NRA views some guns as bad and others as good for civilian ownership. A perfect example of this is the civilian ownership of machine guns. Although it is perfectly legal for civilians in most states to own machine guns, the NRA has never supported that right and will not publicly support the right either. If you don&#8217;t believe me, just send a letter to the NRA asking what their position is on machine guns and they will either ignore you or answer your question with some generic B.S. that doesn&#8217;t really answer your question or send you a bunch of flyers in the mail that have nothing to do with your request.</p><p>If you ask local NRA &#8220;leaders&#8221; they will say things like &#8220;What do you &#8220;need&#8221; those things for?&#8221;, or make some type of comment regarding your sanity for simply wanting to possess a machine gun as a private (non law enforcement) citizen.</p><p>I currently own 15 machine guns and thoroughly enjoy shooting them as much as possible and teaching others about machine guns and legal ownership.</p><p>The NRA was compliant and supported the 1986 ban on civilian ownership of newly manufactured machine guns and for that reason I will not send another penny of my hard earned money to support an organization that does not support me.</p></div><div

We even have a sign up in the shop welcoming people to the United States.  No, I&#8217;m not trying to be &#8216;cute&#8217; but rather being realistic.  We have a number of kalifornia residents in every single day of the month trying to get us to violate federal laws and sell them guns.  Not a gun show goes by where I don&#8217;t have a steady stream of the same thing, asking if I am a &#8216;private seller&#8217; so they can buy things.  Sure, 8 tables of brand new guns, big banner with the shop name and business cards all over the table equals &#8216;private seller.&#8217;  Sure.  I have tried to deal with your laws but have now given up. After getting threatened with a criminal complaint because the stainless version of the gun I shipped was &#8216;illegal&#8217; but the blue one was &#8216;legal&#8217; and they wanted their money back, I formally give up.  I&#8217;ve helped victims, er, a residents, like my customer who could buy the Colt 1911 but since the slide was engraved, it was now  banned gun, so I mailed him the slide directly while the transfer dealer transfered him the receiver.  It just isn&#8217;t worth the mountain of effort to try and keep up with your bazaarness.  But I will still be happy to sell you all the ammo and natural capacity magazines if you stop by the shop, and I will continue to help those who escape by fixing all those stupid &#8216;bullet buttons&#8217; and restoring them to natural working order.</p></div><div

/> here and out of state.  If your business is so good you don&#8217;t need us, stay the hell out.  There are plenty of<br
/> AR builders right here, we&#8217;ll keep &#8217;em all gladly.  If you don&#8217;t like to read, don&#8217;t bother selling guns in California.<br
/> If you don&#8217;t mind doing a little research, you&#8217;ll find you have quite a few choices.  So I had to take off the flash<br
/> suppressor on my M1A and replace it with a compensator, big deal.  10 round mag, who cares?  Buy two or three<br
/> and load them up.  I don&#8217;t get all the whining, sell here and make some money, but I guess you have so much<br
/> you don&#8217;t need our dollars, sounds fine to me.  I look forward to a time when every state has the same laws<br
/> and they cut out the crap that is on the books in many states but until then, I&#8217;ll keep buying right here.<br
/> There are some counties here so hard core right wing that they would make most states look downright liberal.<br
/> This is one big state, don&#8217;t lump us gun enthusiasts in with those under-educated law makers who don&#8217;t know what<br
/> they are doing.  Every state has some stupid laws, you can&#8217;t avoid it, but you can educate yourself and learn<br
/> how to work with it.</p></div><div

They have so many laws in this state that everyone is basically innocent until investigated, so I understand the reluctance of gun dealers and owners to send firearms to Kalifornia. I also agree that unless there is federal civil rights intervention, Kalifornia will continue on the glorious path of socialism, to truly become a workers&#8217; paradise.</p><p>Like most of those who are able; last week we relocated to America; Anthem Arizona to be specific. It is great to finally live in a free country!!! I can now let my kids ride in the bed of a pick-up truck, drive 75mph down the highway, own any Class 3 weapons, Automatic Knives (Switchblades) and can carry a gun in public concealed or unconcealed without a permit of any kind, like the Founding Fathers intended. On top of all that, everything costs less here, people are nice and the schools are excellent. I know longer feel like a &#8220;Thought Criminal&#8221;, as I now live among my peers and fellow citizens.</p><p>California continues to lose population and would not have a net increases in population were it not for the influx of illegal aliens and new births. Producers (tax payers) continue to leave the state and those that stay, like the Hollywood elite, live in Beverly Hills and Malibu, but use their out-of-state residences (ranches in Montana, etc.) to avoid the high taxes levied on the rest of the state&#8217;s population. So those wanting hand outs continue to increase in number while the number of people paying the bills continues to shrink.</p><p>I have friends in California who would like to leave now, but can not because of their professions. Once they retire, they will all be selling their homes and relocating to Nevada, Arizona and Colorado respectively. I wish them the best of luck. Although I wish conservatism would triumph some day in California, I know it will never happen.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Kevin</p></div><div

/> Until the people of California stand up and demand that the US Constitution( especially the 2nd Amendment ) be followed, nothing will change. I agree with the responder who gave the stats about the number of NRA members. The NRA is the outfit that is responsible for challenging and winning all the court cases that threaten to remove our gun rights in this country. They can&#8217;t do that forever without money. Just increasing membership to 20 million instead of the current 4 million would greatly improve the gun rights situation in America. You would think that with the 2nd Amendment we wouldn&#8217;t have to fight so hard to preserve our gun rights. If you are worried about the future of our country, you should join the NRA. They fight hard, every day, to protect our gun rights. If we allow the politicians to continue to attack the 2nd Amendment, we will lose the rest of the Constitution.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6684"><p>So many darkness cursers; so few candle lighters. Sometimes I think the future of the American economy must lie in the Outrage Industry. You California haters, I regret to tell you: Just because the flavor is different doesn&#8217;t mean you aren&#8217;t all drinking your own variety of Kool-Aid.</p><p>I half-respect the opinions of people who have had unsatisfactory experiences trying to ship into California and have made the business decision that it isn&#8217;t worth the aggravation to try to comply with these laws. But I point out that letter of the law interpretations would have clued them in that the gun they were trying to ship in was not going to make the border crossing successfully. Yes the blue/stainless distinction is stupid. But if it&#8217;s documented, what are we to say of a shipper and his prospective resident buyer who tried to slip in a gun that any prudent individual would have known was going to fail? There is a minimum level of awareness required to make a successful gun transaction anywhere, and it is not California&#8217;s fault if the parties to such a transaction in this state aren&#8217;t up to managing the details.</p><p>California has 12 percent of the country&#8217;s population and 15% of its gun buying dollars. For all the arm-waving about &#8220;communist&#8221; policies and &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; restrictions, the residents here manage to buy hundreds of thousands of guns a year from the hundreds of local FFLs and even from the further hundreds of out of state sellers who have no qualms about dealing with CA residents. Are we to think that the comfort levels of those sellers and shippers are the result of misinformation, and that their high volume of successful transactions are purely accidental? The numbers contradict the passionate and mostly uninformed assertions of the California haters.</p><p>Footnote: for those who think CA is a solidly liberal state, consider that the number of conservatives in this state (registered Republicans, Libertarians and conservative independents) exceeds the conservative population of the hard red states South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana combined. Yes, California conservatives are outnumbered in the legislature, a side effect of two decades of faulty reapportionment processes. Let&#8217;s see where this goes in the future.</p><p>Point of information: the &#8220;K&#8221; thing is more demeaning to those who use it than to the Californians they seek to denigrate. Use the K spelling, and you look like a dolt to everyone who isn&#8217;t imprisoned in the hate-California echo chamber.</p><p>Even if this post does not survive moderation, I hope the moderator got something out of it.</p></div><div

Even if you have a 3rd class FFL and the desire to pay for a tax stamp, the newest developments in small arms are now prohibited from civilian ownership. This is very clear violation of the Constitution and is infringement on the right to keep and bear arms. Past Supreme Court decisions have been clear that the 2nd is to allow equal small arms of the government for the people also. Quietly gone! The traitors are busy and now we cannot have anything but yesterdays small arms. It won&#8217;t be long until they&#8217;re at the dorr of all small arms owners with a seizure order.</p></div><div

Those that refuse to sell to California are only hurting the citizenry of California who desire firearms for the same reasons we all do. The leftist polititians are winning when retailers refuse sale to Califonians.<br

Look at California as an example of what can happen to your rights if the leftist are left running the playpen.

/> I&#8217;m not a dealer, so I don&#8217;t have a dog in this hunt. But why do you expect an out-of-stater to risk his livelyhood by selling to you? According to the author, there are plenty of dealers in Kalifornia. Stick it to your legislators yourselves. Do you actually know how far from the rest of the country your state is? You have, by a large margin, the highest Brady score of any state. (Not a good thing). While we all wish every state observed the second amendment, your state is lost. On many fronts.

But these days I&#8217;m not only ashamed, despite doing everything I can ( like voting ) to help get my state back. It seems pretty hopeless. I have bought nearly forty guns, mostly online through auctions, in the last few years. Hopefully they will appreciate and help my retirement when I sell them. I am extremely grateful to dealers who defy my commy govt. and do business with CA buyers like me. It is sort of like &#8220;leave no man behind&#8221;, even if they are behind enemy lines, like gunowners in california are. I badly want to move to a &#8220;free state&#8221;, as do many other californians like me. Here&#8217;s the problem though. Some of us can&#8217;t just pick up and move on a whim, because of our jobs or elderly relatives etc. The other thing is, if all the people who want to get the hell out of Kaleefornia did it, a lot of the people in other states who tell us we should leave, will not like to be &#8220;crowded&#8221; by the all their new neighbors.  They would know first hand how we native californians feel. ( by the invasion of Mexico )</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6710"><p>Yep I totally get the notion of wanting to punish law abiding gun owners, who only want to spend their money with you, because they happen to live in California which has a sucky political climate. We elected only three Democrats as governor in the 20th century, two of them named Brown. But the Democrats have, for most of the past 60 years, had a strangle hold on the Legislature. Governors have signed bad bills harmful to our rights to get bills they needed through. That&#8217;s how politics and the legislative game work, after all.</p><p>What happened to the revolutionary spirit? For all this talk about &#8220;free America&#8221;, it seems to me that many have that concept pretty narrowly defined. But revolution, a peaceful one, is what we are doing here in California, one gun sale, one AR build, one court case at a time. There are hundreds of thousands of us who are dedicated to winning back our rights, and millions more who are law abiding gun owners but who are not intimately involved in the fight like some of us are.</p><p>If out of state FFLs don&#8217;t want to ship direct into California for whatever reason, at least have the decency to ship to a middleman FFL, there are a good number around the country, who is set up to ship into California and is happy to help us.</p><p>Single shot exemption for semi-autos and single action exemption are two different things. Neither are sketchy, both are well documented and the buyer making the gun whole again after delivery is not manufacturing. Understanding the laws that the statists pass, and being able to work within them, is how we will eventually win.</p></div><div

I saw the liberal nuts take away our rights slowly until it was just too much for me to stand anymore. I left for a more gun friendly state and I didn&#8217;t have to go far, I now live in Nevada and feel I can breathe again and fully enjoy my 2nd amendment rights. I can now carry open or concealed. I have had my CCW permit for 6 years and I carry all the time. I own hi-cap mags and rifles with all the &#8220;bad&#8221; attributes. I don&#8217;t have an AK or an AR but, I do have an SKS with a Tapco stock which has a pistol grip and a adjustable stock, same for my Ruger Mini-14 and my 10/22. Like the saying goes, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!&#8221; My advice is leave Cali for a more gun friendly better place, and they are plenty to choose from. The liberals who control Cali will keep introducing more and more restrictive legislation until you won&#8217;t be able to own any form of firearm, long gun, shotgun or handgun. Crime is on the rise as the state creates a state full of &#8220;sheep&#8221; for citizens and the criminal &#8220;wolves&#8221; find it easy pickings with no &#8220;sheepdogs&#8221; around to defend everyone. Just try to get a CCW permit in any big cities where crime is high and you will be refused. If you live in a rural county, you are more likely to get one but, crime just isn&#8217;t that high there, less people to commit against and they are more likely to be armed! I don&#8217;t see things getting better in Cali, just worse and that is most unfortunate. Just watch, if the National reciprocity bill passes the US Senate and it becomes law, Cali will become like Illinois and outlaw concealed carry, they will then revoke all CCW permits, they will prevent anyone from within or outside of Cali from being able to carry concealed there.</p></div><div

And the NRA and other gun rights groups have ignored our state for years, thinking us all a lost cause.     (They associate ALL New Yorkers, with New York City.)    New York state&#8217;s assault weapons ban is very vague.   ANYONE who purchases an AR-15 style gun or a semi-auto version of the AK-47 SHOULD be on on guard at all times  that some DA will use the vague law to beat them down.   We DO have gun owners in NY who would benefit if the NRA decided to sponsor some pro-gun legislation, but the agency seems to ignore us.</p></div><div

Telling us to &#8220;move, vote out the antis or stay out of my state&#8221;,  you are not demonstrating your support of 2A rights for all.  Look, we are fellow firearm enthusiasts.

That gas can is just an example of what you can expect in the future.   Having more guns here is not the point.  Manufacturers and dealers have substantial resources that they and their governmental affairs associates leverage to &#8216;fight&#8217; the back **wards laws/restrictions the antis are vigorously pushing , right?</p><p>If these same companies used their noggins and put their &#8216;holier than thou&#8217; attitude aside for the &#8217;cause&#8217; they could then see that a very large state with a very large enthusiast population is a great source for additional resources to help sustain strong 2A rights.   Self preservation my brothers!    I am doing my part, right now,  on a broadly read forum, educating and informing others how to help.   Cursing the darkness has never brought light.</p><p>I admit I commiserate with my fellow forum members on Calguns.net (we call ourselves &#8216;calgunners&#8217;) and may rant some.   I am not blaming anyone for their, correct, opinion that California legislators are blowin&#8217; it up here.  Just want everyone to know that calgunners are up to their elbows in the muddy trenches and deserve your support&#8230;. the gas can is just &#8216;the camel&#8217;s nose under the tent&#8217;.

They are not willing to discount firearms, most charge full list.</p><p>If you wish to buy a C&amp;R handgun from out of state, you will find that the FFL may not even do this for you, if they do, they want $100 of more for a single out of state transfer. This is designed to keep them expensive and to fill the coffers of the gun stores.</p><p>As a businessman, myself, I do realize that it cost a lot more to do business in California, but with a state sponsored monopoly, we get the shaft, which is exactly what the Calif gun laws are designed to do. They do deserve to make a profit, but there is no need to be competive</p><p>C&amp;R rifles can be shipped directly to the C&amp;R licensee and the licensee can buy C&amp;R handguns out of state(but may not bring back assembled hi cap mags), so we have to leave the state on a buying trip if we want a decent price on collectible handguns.</p></div><div

What needs to happen is a 10th and possibly a 14th amendment lawsuit. By not allowing weapons into the state that are built to very exacting industry standards, that are accepted by the other 49 normal states, Ca. has set themselves aside and said we are special, and in the process have violated the interstate commerce clause by not allowing weapons in, and charging what basically amounts to a tax to do business here. Plus there is a question of equal treatment under the law that comes up. At the Shot Show I asked several manufacturers about this, and to a one, they said that&#8217;s a great idea, but all of them were unwilling to look into it further, mostly I got &#8220;why don&#8217;t you talk with the NRA&#8221;, but when I did, I was stone walled. Maybe I am just nuts, misguided, or flat out wrong, but everyday this state goes unchallened on their progressive/ marxist policies is a day lost to history, and the undoing of our country.</p></div><div

The answer here, like Barrett firearms who will not repair any law enforcement Barrett .50 rifles and if sent in will confiscate them. We, the rest of the USA, should participate in an all-out boycott of sales of any firearms or ammunition to anyone in Kalifornia, including Law Enforcement. If you can Boycott everything please do so. Doing firearm business with anyone in Kalifornia is as wrong as the US selling nuclear bombs to Iran. The State is an enemy of all free Americans.<br

I do not deserve to pay the price for the mistakes of my fellow former, especially when I continue to fight on the losing side of this war of attrition we have going on here.  Keeping guns out of California will only hasten its demise, and give the federal government a blueprint for disarming folks in every other state as well.  Read the Rio Conference publication of the UN (1992), particularly where the UN admits to their reasoning behind pushing for the abolition of legal gun ownership.</p><p>Give them an inch and they&#8217;ll take a mile.

California really is doomed.  If anything, the firearms laws will only get worse.  I have a long time friend who moved out there 3 years ago and he has met many people.  Over time, a few of those people that he has met trusted him enough to let him in on a little secret&#8230;.they are illegal.  Even he, someone who could care less about guns, is extremely upset by this.  The job market is flooded there with every leftist in the world trying to move there because they want to be on TV.</p><p>If the gun owners moved out, California will undoubtedly lose all of its producers.  The author of this article said, bring more guns into California to fight back.  I think many have the hopes that if they send LESS guns, the gun owners will leave and the state will lose a large part of their earners.  Rise up California&#8230;.and leave : )</p></div><div

Overall, their influence and firearms freedom advocacy are very positive forces and I encourage every gun owner to join their ranks.   As a FFL in FL, I am happy to sell to CA as it&#8217;s a huge market and not particulary burdensome to navigate.    I would certainly like to see more efforts made to liberalize gun ownership there and a strong NRA lobby is a good way to start.</p></div><div

I feel sorry for you folks over there, I really do.  But I am tired of the whining.  I purposely avoid California like the plague and if living there impacts your lifestyle so much, why do you stay?  I know packing up and moving is no easy task and jobs are hard to find.  However, if these issues are such a big deal, you need to decide what is more important to you.  I am not a dealer but I see exactly why they don&#8217;t ship there.  It&#8217;s not their fault that you live in the worst state of the nation; not just because of the gun laws, either.</p><p>There is too much red tape to tip toe around in that state as far as firearms sales go and personally, I would not care to read about your laws.  There are 49 other states who want firearms (with New Jersey and NY getting close to Cali standards).  Putting your FFL at risk because you sold a firearm to someone who later converted it to something they thought was legal is not a smart business move.</p><p>Face it, your state sucks and it is not any one&#8217;s fault that you live there.  It is not the firearm community&#8217;s job to cater to your wants.  Join the real America or stay in la la land, it&#8217;s your choice&#8230;&#8230;Time to go load some 30 round mags for my next range trip : )</p></div><div

As a lifelong California resident, it hurts to see my State be in such a terrible condition, but you&#8217;re exactly right &#8211; the more guns in California the better!</p><p>It&#8217;s onerous and difficult sometimes, but places that simply refuse to sell to California because of principle are simply being ignorant and are losing sales. As a business owner myself, I don&#8217;t like this State. It is very anti-business, but I also find it sort of cocky for an out of state business to just willingly lose sales on principle alone.</p><p>What-ev&#8230;</p></div><div

Buy from in-state sellers! Apparently the easy money you claim your residents are willing to spend is not worth the headache for out of state dealers. Learn to live with it. I live in a &#8220;flyover state&#8221; so am able to buy unrestricted ammo, locally or through the internet. Can have C&amp;R weapons delivered to my house. Don&#8217;t have to show ID for bullets. Don&#8217;t have to wait X days to pick up a firearm. Don&#8217;t have to buy &#8220;&#8230;.(fill in the liberal state) compliant&#8221; firearms. Etc. When I bought my wife a nice SW (thank you Bill Clinton) model 60, it had an integral lock on it. Why do I need a lock on a gun I keep in a safe? While I empathize with your plight, it&#8217;s certainly not my job to fix your legislature or your citizenry. If your state had its way, I would be in the same boat as you&#8212;and with your number of Electoral College votes, I cringe every election. Two weeks ago when I was cleaning my Garand, I was reminded of the idiocy Kalifornia has spawned: the Delrin muzzle protector I use came with a warning label that goes (almost verbatim) like this&#8212;&#8220;WARNING-This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause Cancer.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a piece of solid black plastic about the size of a wine cork with a brass sleeve through the middle of it. I found the same warning on a plastic leaf rake I bought a decade ago. If you think the beauty of your state outweighs the insanity that your legislature imposes, stay there and enjoy. Don&#8217;t scold those who want nothing to do with your madness. Oh, and way to go, Ronnie Barrett.</p></div><div

I just built a LR-308 with 20 rd magazines, flash suppressor, and all the horrible assault features that make liberals in Calif. urinate down their legs.  A visit to the Koko Head range on a weekend looks like the firing line at Camp Pendleton with all the AR types.</p><p>There are dumb things here, like 10 rd magazine limit for rifles that may have a pistol variant, AR/AK, and 10 rd limit for handguns.  Regardless, the rifle 10 rd limit for AR/AK is widely ignored, 30 rd mags are everywhere and no one cares.  M1A, LR-308, and FAL don&#8217;t matter, no pistol variant.</p><p>CCW is non-existant, but a movement is ongoing to sue to change that.</p><p>I sold most of my collection before moving here form Calif, and now regret doing so.</p></div><div

Give California to China and we can start over again. The Socialist Liberals out there should be in favor of this kind of a move. In 1776 we rose up to free ourselves from a government that is doing the same exact thing ours is now. There are only a handful of States that don&#8217;t respect the rights of their citizens. CA is the worst, closely followed by NY, NJ, MA and IL. They are all &#8220;Blue&#8221; states. We have met the enemy and he is us. Don&#8217;t forget to vote in November and any time there is an opportunity to take our country back from the Liberals.</p></div><div

My wife and I both have CCWs and carry daily and I have a C&amp;R FFL.  Gun ownership in the rural areas is very high.  If you do a websearch on gun ownership you will find there are between 7 and 8 million legal gun owners in Calif. and most own more than one gun.  I am a retired engineer and marketing exec.  The company I worked for did a lot of business with the US government and the rules and regs were always a pain to deal with but we did it because it was a big market with money to be made.  Anyone who ignores Calif. is cutting off their own nose and giving the business to someone who is focued on the bottom line.  Secondly, and mabye more importanly, if you choose not to sell guns to Calif. residents then the anti-gun liberals really have won.</p></div><div

It doesn&#8217;t necessitate a black robe to understand the 2nd amendment and know that gun law &#8220;infringe&#8221; upon the right to keep and bear arms. In order to apply this concept of nullification of obviously unconstitutional law would require having the American spirit of freedom, courage, and &#8220;rule of law&#8221; not &#8220;rule of men&#8221;.</p><p>Sadly most Americans don&#8217;t have courage and simply accept obvious BS laws as legitimate so they don&#8217;t have to address being cowards.</p><p>Another solution to help Kalifornians is for them to move to another state, but they will still have to deal with the ideals above as all states violate the 2nd amendment.</p><p>The obvious solution to this gun rights issue nationwide is to have some balls and own, make, &#8220;acquire&#8221; whatever gun you think you need and ignore obvious BS laws. When an unlawful arrest may occur it would be an assault like any other and can be resisted like any other assault, up to and including lethal force if necessary, and then use your 2nd amendment RIGHT to defend yourself. This is common sense and the opinion of the USSC as well regarding unlawful arrests!</p><p>This is how I live my life.

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6817"><p>The article doesn&#8217;t mention another way around the handgun roster. Dealers can not legally sell you a non-rostered gun from their inventory. But private party transfers are exempt. So if you want, say, a Colt Python, you can legally buy one if you can find a private owner to sell you his. Calguns.net is a great place to look for one. But the owner must be a CA resident and the gun must already be in CA. I lived in San Diego for 16 years and saw all the smaller gun shops go under. No new ones are opening, because of the legal and buisness climate there is so hostile. I&#8217;m in AZ now. The irony is that you can&#8217;t buy a high quality gun like a Python or a Trooper, but you can sitll buy a pot metal POS like a Lorcin brand new. Liberals&#8230;.</p></div><div

I ship through an FFL and he will not jump through the hoops necessary to be able to ship to CA.  I don&#8217;t blame him.  Their &#8220;drop test&#8221; for guns is garbage too.  They go out of their way to make the whole process more effort than it&#8217;s worth.

Colt isn&#8217;t about to spend the money keeping them listed when they are no longer in production just to please the CA DOJ (it&#8217;s not cheap). A few manufacturers do this for their older models, but not many. Like I said, the irony is that this &#8220;safe handgun law&#8221; was meant to ban pot metal guns like the Lorcin and Davis. But they where able to get certified anyway. So the law abiding gun owner get punished while the creep who needs a throw away gun to stick up liquer stores still can get his.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6824"><p>Howdy folks-<br
/> The article that fired this here discussion off had its merits and its shortcomings.<br
/> Some one said once, a long time ago, that people get the kind of government they deserve.<br
/> It would seem that California has a problem. That problem may be the small voice of the rural voters, and the overbearing weight of the vote in certain un-named municipalities in the state. Or it may be something else entirely. Most aspects of their &#8216;problem&#8217; have been weighed fairly thoroughly by different authors during this discussion. A very interesting debate, guys.<br
/> There is some truth to the thought that we can stand together, or we can die alone. Truth can also be found in the concept that the State of California may have placed itself in a position beyond redemption.<br
/> The options for the residents of that once great state are are somewhat limited, but their actions must follow their words. In the simplest terms, they still have three choices.<br
/> 1-Abandon the state, move to &#8216;Free America&#8217; or elsewhere. Leave your California mind behind.<br
/> 2-Change the standing government, the laws that offend, by whatever means is appropriate. Take responsibility.<br
/> 3-Decide to tolerate the intolerable. No guts, no glory, but who needs glory anyhow?<br
/> Someone has to do what needs to be done. The rest of the country won&#8217;t be able to do it for the poor Californians. If people of that State choose to continue its soft slavery, then who am I to say they are wrong? It may be wrong for me, but I aint them.<br
/> Although the NRA is an imperfect tool, it is better than the alternatives in most things. There are State Rifle Associations in all of the 50. They may be more responsive to the local needs and demands than the NRA can be. Get active.<br
/> There is also an underlying sense of fear that taking action, joining the club, or speaking out, may place one in jeopardy by making a person visible on the radar. Falling afoul of the powers is one way to awaken from apathy, although not a recommended method.<br
/> I have lived there, and worked there, and paid taxes there. I found that I could not tolerate living on the coast, the people were bound up in such a tiny world. Moving inland still didn&#8217;t cut the interference enough. I left. I still have some family there, but the smartest ones have left for America.<br
/> California is like boiling a frog. Raise the temperature slowly and it doesn&#8217;t even notice. Frog death is not a price I choose to pay. I will not cross the Ca. state line, I will not do business there. I will not see my family there. They are (still) free to leave Ca. to visit me, but I will not go there.<br
/> But then again, I refuse to put up with TSA groping and crap, so I don&#8217;t fly in America any more. Has anyone noticed that airport security is less intrusive and demeaning in most countries that allow travel?</p><p>IF the Californians staged the sort of rebellion that the tree huggers loved in the Arab Spring, what would be the national response? The Federal response? The Media response? The local reaction? One has to wonder.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6833"><p>You raise very good points, and there ARE several groups working here in CA (NRA, SAF, CRPA, Calguns) that are leading the charge against the gun-control laws of this state.  Because we are outnumbered in the legislature, and in the general populace, we can only accomplish this in the courts, riding on the coat-tails of the Heller and MacDonald victories in the Supreme Court.  We were successful at defeating AB 962 in court, which would have killed most online ammunition orders to CA residents.  We have gotten several county sheriffs to change their stance/procedures on issuing CCW permits.  We defeated the outright ban of handguns in SF.  We currently have cases to make the safe handgun roster go away, to steer CA to a &#8220;shall issue&#8221; policy for CCW permits, and others.  Check out Calguns.net for more info&#8230;the fight is far from over!</p></div><div

Find out who in your neighborhood may be a gun control advocate, find out where they work, and then call a boycott on the business until the gun control advocate is fired.  Repeat this step at the next job they get.  Do all you can with in the limits of the law to make their life a living hell.  Give them real problems in life, again, stay within the limits of the law.  Boycott businesses that give to gun control advocacy groups. Support businesses like Starbucks for standing up to the Brady Campaign.  We have to be active in defending our rights and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6858"><p>In Florida we have a State law stating to the effect NO local or county government may make a law regarding  firearms. Any city or county doing so will be fined and the individual politicians who vote for the law will also be fined to the tune of $5,000. What is needed is a National law along these lines. That way there would be no confusion from state to state and our 2nd ammendment rights would be protected. We have a national election comming up. It would be great if one of the Conservatives would grow a set and suggest such a thing. This is America. We can&#8217;t rise up and revolt like we did in 1776 because we value our country too much and with today&#8217;s technology it would be impossible. Not only that, I can&#8217;t see any American taking up arms against another American. A foreign government? YES in a heartbeat, but our military and police are our people and we support them both 100%. It&#8217;s the Legislative branches of our government that are destroying our country on a daily basis. Why should illegal aliens be legal and legal firearms be declared illegal? California needs America more than America needs California. The State is big enough, let them seceed or sell the place to China if they do not want to live like the rest of us. As for guns. There are plenty of other buyers out there in the real America. Clean up your own house then come join the rest of America.</p></div><div

I am a solid gun owner/user and think this is pure stupidity. The criminals are just going to use their girlfriends and others who want to make a buck to start buying like they used to. The sad thing is those guns will go to states that don&#8217;t have a policy for concealed carry like we do in Virginia. At least in Virginia we can carry to confront the threat. In the states those weapons are going to, they don&#8217;t have that option on a wide basis. So I agree we should make all states a level &#8220;playing field&#8221;. Just as we should make all drug laws the same.<br
/> I&#8217;m glad Virginia gives me the option to carry, but I don&#8217;t agree with sending guns to states that don&#8217;t have the same policies. While I&#8217;m at it, Bloomberg is a corporate storm trooper. I&#8217;m sure he would like Israel to disarm to solve the middle east problem also, you think?</p></div><div

Obviously the residents of CA cant change their own gun laws, so maybe we can help them from outside the state, by bans and boycotts. Course it would help if S&amp;W and others stop selling to CA govt agencies like Barrett.  At a minimum any magazine over 10 rounds should not be allowed at CA govt purchases either.<br
/> And if the residents of CA want guns they cant have, or want to CCW..Maybe they should move?  Nobody is forcing anyone to live there.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6911"><p>I applaud Gunsamerica for this article.  It&#8217;s a great start at explaining the predicament.  Maybe in the future they could start a series covering some of the issues people would have to call in to CA DOJ for help with.  Many people won&#8217;t do the legwork but just might read it if it&#8217;s served on a platter as nicely as this article was.  Kudos.</p><p>Now, on to the commenters.</p><p>SDDutch&#8217;s statement &#8220;I am a gun owner and I am not a member of the NRA for one very specific reason. The NRA does not support all gun owners.&#8221; typifies what is wrong with the gun community.  &#8220;If they don&#8217;t support my pet peeve then they are not deserving of my support (even though they&#8217;ve done so much already to ensure the rights I currently enjoy).&#8221;  Millions of gunowners throughout the US, with the majority apparently in so-called &#8220;free&#8221; states, are keeping their money to themselves because they think they don&#8217;t have a dog in this fight.  So you&#8217;ll only support them if they support you first.  Typical.  Too bad you can&#8217;t see beyond your own nose.  That same kind of thinking is what divided gunowners over in the UK (oh, they don&#8217;t want to ban MY gun&#8230;.well then I won&#8217;t get in the way) and look what that lead to (a foot in the door followed by a total ban).</p><p>We here in California who are oppressed by the liberal majority are asking the rest of the country to stop being so selfish and give a little support.  Yes, it may involve more paperwork but the more who take on this challenge the better.  Maybe the DOJ will tire from the paperwork alone.  Like DCW, I can at least understand when someone says they won&#8217;t sell to us because it&#8217;s inconvenient or when they quote having too many bad experiences, like Bert (it is your business after all), but what I don&#8217;t understand is the utter ignorance and contempt some people here are showing for those of us who are victimized by these laws.</p><p>Drop the &#8220;K&#8221; from &#8220;Kalifornia, it&#8217;s ignorant and quit being funny about 5 minutes after the first million people used it.  All it does is make the rulemakers feel confident that they won&#8217;t have to worry about being flanked by supporters from outside of the state.</p><p>Californians are fighting the hard fight that many of you enjoy no longer having to fight.  Now you&#8217;re resting on your butts and pointing out how bad we have it here in CA (only in regards to politics in the metro areas, the weather and environment are still awesome and you&#8217;re just jealous).  We only have so many conservatives in this state to affect change, but we&#8217;re simply outnumbered.  I&#8217;m a native conservative independent Californian and a veteran.  I have NEVER shirked my responsibilities by not voting.  I know I sure as hell didn&#8217;t vote for these laws so don&#8217;t sit there with a pompous (unearned) grin and tell me I deserve what I got. Yeah, I&#8217;m talking to you Shootstright.</p><p>Gatorpaw is right.  If more of you joined the NRA they could start fighting more to get rid of the stupid laws throughout the nation, including here in CA, and then we could be free to support you by buying firearms that have not been available here for years.  As DCW pointed out, we&#8217;ve got a lot of pent up demand and money to spend, and those who work with us are reaping the benefits without much competition.  Defeatist comments like those from Rich, John, or Hernadez (why don&#8217;t you just move?) show me just how much conviction many of you have to stand on (you&#8217;re just as bad, if not worse, than the Antis).  Stand together with your fellow 2A brothers and sisters and it will eventually help you, and not just financially.  Or you can continue going about your lives being lazy, selfish, and judgmental&#8230;all the while thinking that what happens here couldn&#8217;t ever happen to you.  Go on, get going back to your couches&#8230;I don&#8217;t want someone on my side who will take the easy path without putting up a fight anyway.</p><p>Me, I&#8217;m gonna stick around and be a sheepdog (thanks Ernie) keeping the wolves away.  Yeah, it&#8217;s hard work but it&#8217;s worth it.</p></div><div

I now have a Texas DL, i got it yesterday.No more &#8220;no sales to CA&#8221;, no more waiting periods, no more &#8220;safe handguns&#8221;.Now i am only limited by  how much money i got in the bank, even through the company paid for my move, it still cost a lot to buy a new house and furnish it.I am still moving in to my new house. I think the weather sucks here, today it&#8217;s 75 degrees, last week it was 26, that was the low here.I still miss CA, even if i am much more free here .P&gt;S&gt; I can now get a C &amp; R pistol shipped to my new house, no waiting, no FFL.YAHOO</p></div><div

The weather here is insane but the first time I walked into a gun store, I felt like I was back in time ( 1988 ). I think it sucks that all my little brother talks about now when we&#8217;re on the phone is airsoft guns! I purchased AKs because of the Clinton gun ban (89), and the first week I went out and bought every Tapco accessory I could put on it. I love the fact that you can get supressors here and that my neighbors ( and I mean all of them ) carry. GUN LAWS DON&#8217;T MAKE YOUR STATE SAFE, THEY RUIN INDUSTRY.</p></div><div

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-6995"><p>All,<br
/> Awesome discussion! It would be GREATLY appreciated and BENEFICIAL if we stopped calling firearms “weapons” please see the REAL definition of a weapon:<br
/> The free dictionary dot com:<br
/> A comprehensive term for all instruments of offensive or defensive combat</p><p>Dictionary dot com:  weap•on<br
/>    [wep-uhn] noun<br
/> 1. any instrument or device for use in attack or defense in combat, fighting, or war, as a sword, rifle, or cannon.</p><p>I am a California resident and have been for most of my life and DESPISE Feinstein, Boxer, Pelosi and their ILK! I have voted against EVERY gun control initiative that I’ve been aware of. Sneaky BA$TARD$ they are will propose a law for say more inner city parks, or as they say here green belts but at the bottom of the bill in TEENY WEANNIE letters is some ridicules anti “FIREARM” law so we must stay vigilant!</p><p>Concerning the term WEAPON this only gives the anti’s more ammo and paints a picture of Rambo “tearin it up” with his dual wielding M-60’s. I just can’t see my 10/22 Ruger or Beretta over-n-under being used as weapons; while they have the ability to be used as such they are not. Just ask yourselves how many of your firearms have been used for offensive or defensive COMBAT???</p><p> While in the US Army I carried an M-203 and a 1911, those I considered weapons, in the civilian world most of us use our firearms for hunting, punching paper and protecting our RIGHT to the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness…</p><p>Under definition a WEAPON could be a baseball bat or “God forbid” the all fearing tennis racket, especially the black ones! Here in California we have lost so much ground and the only way to get it back is the same way we lost it, one little slice at a time!</p><p>We can present ourselves intelligently and start by using the term FIREARMS, an all encompassing term for what they really are, inanimate tools. In closing, I would like to thank the dealers that do support us! My last three purchases have been from out of state vendors! One was a bolt action rifle; one was a complete AR-15 the other a stripped AR lower so I could build my own AR FIREARM for coyote hunting! We must stick together as Americans, that is what separates us from the rest of the world&#8230;</p></div><div

Read on.</p><p>&#8220;A Nation of Sheep will beget a Government of Wolves.&#8221; &#8211;  Edward R. Murrow</p><p>You&#8217;re sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door.  Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled whispers.  At least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way.<br
/> With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun.  You rack a shell into the chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.<br
/> In the darkness, you make out two shadows.  One holds something that looks like a crowbar.  When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the shotgun and fire.<br
/> The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.  One writhes and screams while the second  man crawls to the front door and lurches outside.<br
/> As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you&#8217;re in trouble.<br
/> In your country, most guns were outlawed years before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless..<br
/> Yours was never registered.  Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.  They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal Possession of a Firearm.<br
/> When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry: authorities will probably<br
/> plea the case down to manslaughter.<br
/> &#8220;What kind of sentence will I get?&#8221; you ask.<br
/> &#8220;Only ten-to-twelve years, &#8220;he replies, as if that&#8217;s nothing.<br
/> &#8220;Behave yourself, and you&#8217;ll be out in seven.&#8221;<br
/> The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper.<br
/> Somehow, you&#8217;re portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot<br
/> are represented as choirboys.<br
/> Their friends and relatives can&#8217;t find an unkind word to say about them.  Buried deep down in the article, authorities acknowledge that both &#8220;victims&#8221; have been arrested numerous times.<br
/> But the next day&#8217;s headline says it all: &#8220;Lovable Rogue Son Didn&#8217;t Deserve to Die.&#8221;<br
/> The thieves have been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type pranksters.<br
/> As the days wear on, the story takes wings.  The national media picks it up, then the international media.<br
/> The surviving burglar has become a folk hero.<br
/> Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he&#8217;ll probably win.<br
/> The media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you&#8217;ve been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects.<br
/> After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time.  The District Attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.<br
/> A few months later, you go to trial.  The charges haven&#8217;t been reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted .<br
/> When you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works against you.<br
/> Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean, vengeful man.  It doesn&#8217;t take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.  The judge sentences you to life in prison.</p><p>This case really happened!</p><p>On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk , England , killed one burglar and wounded a second.  In April, 2000, he was convicted and is now serving a life term&#8230;  How did it become a crime to defend one&#8217;s own life in the once great British Empire ?</p><p>It started with the Pistols Act of 1903.<br
/> This seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license.<br
/> The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.<br
/> Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns.  Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987.  Michael Ryan, a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw.  When the smoke cleared, 17 people were dead.</p><p>The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of &#8220;gun control&#8221;,  demanded even tougher restrictions.  (The seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan used a rifle.)</p><p>Nine years later, at Dunblane , Scotland , Thomas Hamilton used a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school.<br
/> For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable, or worse, criminals.  Now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners.<br
/> Day after day, week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns.  The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens.<br
/> During the years in which the British government incrementally took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism.  Authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened, claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun.  Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released.</p><p>Indeed, after the Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying,<br
/> &#8220;We cannot have people take the law into their own hands.&#8221;  All of Martin&#8217;s neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences.  Martin himself, a collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars.</p><p>When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.  Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law.  The few who didn&#8217;t were visited by police and threatened with ten-year prison sentences if they didn&#8217;t comply.  Police later bragged that they&#8217;d taken nearly 200,000 handguns from private citizens.</p><p>How did the authorities know who had handguns?  The guns had been registered and licensed.  Kind of like cars.  Sound familiar?</p><p>WAKE UP AMERICA ; THIS IS WHY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION.</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people&#8217;s minds..&#8221;<br

class="comment_text grt" id="comment-body-7858"><p>I live in California.  First, it&#8217;s not the dealers that are shrinking the Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale in California, it&#8217;s the manufacturers (once you get past it being the politicians and the idiots who vote for them of course).  And I don&#8217;t blame the manufacturers.  When the Auto Industry tests a car for safety, they test a model and that is it.  They don&#8217;t need to test every color and configuration or all possible combinations to qualify for approved sale.  For instance, if a firearm manufacturer has one model, and that model comes in 4 styles (e.g. blued, parkerized, stainless, bitone) and also comes with either fiber or tritium sights and, lastly, if the grips come in 5 styles (cocobolo, black plastic, pink plastic, pearl, hard rubber) the number of guns they must get tested to offer all of the combinations in California is 390,625.  Do you really believe they can sell enough to recover the cost of testing that many guns to destruction?  You may argue that they can supply just a few of those combinations, but they&#8217;ve tried that.  They&#8217;ve likely found that consumers are reluctant to part with as much as 1/3 of their monthly take-home pay for a gun they don&#8217;t want, but is all they can have (at least not more than once).</p><p>As for Dealers; let&#8217;s say I want a Ruger, P345PR / Steel, Polymer .45 ACP.  I order it on May 7th.  Due to problems with the shipping co., instead of 12 days, it takes 30 days to arrive at the CFFL (don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s unlikely, at least 30% of the items I order shipped get &#8220;misplaced&#8221; for days and several were lost for weeks despite tracking #s).  On May 27, 2012 it drops off the Roster.  No one knows whether it is legal for the CFFL to transfer that gun now, so, to be safe, he rejects the package.  Now the Dealer is out the transaction cost (e.g. the credit card processing fee, possibly the shipping fee).  And he must document the return of the firearm for BATFE who will undoubtedly assume an illegal and nefarious purpose.  Further, it is illegal for the Dealer to &#8220;alter&#8221; the gun for sale in California (so changing out a 17 rd. magazine for a 10 rd. mag. is forbidden).  Why would a dealer in another state carry stock that no one who is not in California will buy?</p><p>No.  Unless we can force a change in Sacramento or in the courts, I can&#8217;t blame anyone, but my neighbors.</p></div><div

California, the home of nearly 40,000,000 people. This is the front lines of the battle for all our 2nd amendment rights.
